# When _bridgeType is equal to 1, the "Across bridge" transaction may fail and result in user fund lock because of the insufficient input validation in _bridgeAssetDirect

## Summary

When _bridgeType is equal to 1, the "Across bridge" transaction may fail because of insufficient input validation in _bridgeAssetDirect

## Vulnerability Detail

this is the current implementation may to handle the bridge transaction if the bridge type is set to 1 is

```solidity
 if (_bridgeType == 1) {
    // Across bridge can be called through defined interface, the variable of fee percentage
    // is depending on gas price conditions in the target chain and is retrieved by the
    // application off-chain by calling the Across bridge API
    uint256 feePct;
    assembly {
        // offset 0x20 to data and 0x14 to tightly packed address, at offset 0x34 32 bytes expected are fee pct
        feePct := mload(add(_bridgeTxData, 0x34))
    }
    IAcrossBridgeSpokePool(targetAddress).deposit(
        cardPartnerAddress,
        cardTopupToken,
        _amount,
        1, // L1 Eth mainnet
        uint64(feePct), // max is 495_000_000_000_000_000 (49.5%) fee (bridge has 50% fee allowed as max)
        uint32(block.timestamp));
}
```

Let's layout the parameter for this crucial function deposit

```solidity
// Interface to represent Across bridge spoke pool on L2
interface IAcrossBridgeSpokePool {
    // recipient is the target address in the outgoing bridge tx in target chain (this is settlement forwarder contract)
    // origin token is the token address in the source chain
    // amount is the source token amount
    // destinationChainId is 1 in the use case of card topup (L1 Eth)
    // relayerFeePct is the fee amount that bridge is allowed to charge for bridging (depends on target chain gas price)
    // quoteTimestamp (relates for fee percentage) should be recent enough (10 minutes check in bridge code)
    function deposit(
        address recipient,
        address originToken,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 destinationChainId,
        uint64 relayerFeePct,
        uint32 quoteTimestamp) payable external;
}
```

I want to quote the specification from the "Across bridge" transaction and discuss every of the parameter.

https://docs.across.to/v2/developers/selected-contract-functions#deposit

This recipient and originToken has no issue. For the parameter "amount", 

I want to quote

> Note on amount limits: If the amount is set too high, it can take a while for the deposit to be filled depending on available relayer liquidity. If the amount is set too low, it can be unprofitable to relay regardless of the relayer fee %. Query the suggested max and min limits [here](https://github.com/v2/developers/across-api#querying-limits). The contracts will not revert if the amount is set outside of the recommended range, so it is highly recommended to set amount within the suggested limits to avoid locking up funds for an unexpected length of time.

In the current implementation the maxAmount and minAmount is used for both Synapse bridge and Across bridge, but parameter that applies to synpase bridge does not necessarily apply to Across bridge.

And the amount is supplied by the user. If the worst case, the contracts will not revert if the amount is set outside of the recommended range

For parameter destinationChainId, has no issue.

For relayerFeePct, this is important

> relayerFeePct % of amount to pay to relayer. Must be less than 0.5e18 (i.e. 50%). Suggested fees can be queried [here](https://github.com/v2/developers/across-api#calculating-suggested-fees). Be careful: if this % is set too low, relayers could be disincentivized to fill this deposit quickly. This can be sped up by calling speedUpDeposit.

the problem is, if the raylerFeePct is too high, the user may lose up to 50% of the fund on the bridge fee. The user may not willing to do that, but there is no option to revert the transaction if the bridge is too high.

For parameter quoteTimestamp,

the doc suggest

> Note on setting quoteTimestamp: 
Call the read-only function getCurrentTime() to get the current UNIX timestamp on the origin chain. e.g. this could return: 1665418548.
Call the read-only function depositQuoteTimeBuffer() to get the buffer around the current time that the quoteTimestamp must be set to. e.g. this could return: 600.
quoteTimestamp must be <= currentTime + buffer and >= currentTime - buffer.

I think calling query the bridge contract to get getCurrentTime() is safer than setting block.timestamp directly.

## Impact

In the worst case, the user fund can be locked or lose a great amount of the fund in the fee.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol set a special limit bound and a lower bound for Across bridge to account for Across bridge liquidity to limit the amount of bridged tokens to avoid fund lock.

We recommend reverting the transaction if the raylerFeePct is too high and let users decide what is percentage they are willing to pay for the bridge fee.

We recommend calling query the bridge contract to get getCurrentTime() and check the buffer to set quoteTimestamp instead of setting block.timestamp directly.
