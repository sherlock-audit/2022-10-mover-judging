# Lack of validation of Synapse bridge calldata allows stealing of funds

## Summary
The Synapse bridge is called via the `call` function and the calldata is passed from the user as is, without validation. This allows a malicious actor to bridge the funds stored on `HardenedTopupProxy` and send them to an address belonging to the malicious actor.
## Vulnerability Detail
[HardenedTopupProxy](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L68) is a contract that relays token transfers from an L2 network to an L1 network, where user debit card settlement will be made.  The contract supports [two bridges](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L293): Synapse and Across. Since these bridges have different interfaces to interact with them, custom bridge calldata is passed during payment relays (`_bridgeTxData`):
```solidity
if (_bridgeType == 0) // @audit-info Synapse
{
    // Synapse bridge call data is retrieved by performing a call by the application
    // to bridge SDK and is not transformed by this contract
    bytes memory callData = _bridgeTxData.slice(20, _bridgeTxData.length - 20);
    (bool success, ) = targetAddress.call(callData); // @audit calldata can be manipulated
    require(success, "BRIDGE_CALL_FAILED");
} else if (_bridgeType == 1) { // @audit-info Across
    // Across bridge can be called through defined interface, the variable of fee percentage
    // is depending on gas price conditions in the target chain and is retrieved by the
    // application off-chain by calling the Across bridge API
    uint256 feePct;
    assembly {
        // offset 0x20 to data and 0x14 to tightly packed address, at offset 0x34 32 bytes expected are fee pct
        feePct := mload(add(_bridgeTxData, 0x34))
    }
    IAcrossBridgeSpokePool(targetAddress).deposit(cardPartnerAddress,
        cardTopupToken,
        _amount,
        1, // L1 Eth mainnet
        uint64(feePct), // max is 495_000_000_000_000_000 (49.5%) fee (bridge has 50% fee allowed as max)
        uint32(block.timestamp));
} else {
    revert("unknown bridge");
}
```

As you can see, the Synapse bridge is called via `call`, and the bridge calldata is passed as is. Bridge calldata is not validated in [_processTopup](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L296) or any of the three public functions that call it ([CardTopupPermit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L1005), [CardTopupTrusted](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L1031), [CardTopupMPTProof](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L1056)).
This allows a malicious actor to perform custom calls on the Synapse bridge on behalf of the `HardenedTopupProxy` contract.
## Impact
Some example exploit scenarios:
1. Scenario 1:
    1. an attacker calls `CardTopupPermit` and sends USDC to `HardenedTopupProxy`;
    1. the bridge calldata parameter contains a call that deposits tokens to the bridge and sets destination address to an address controlled by the attacker;
    1. the attacker receives their USDC on a L1 bridge;
    1. since `HardenedTopupProxy` emitted a [CardTopup](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L324) event, they also had their Move card topped up with the same amount.
1. Scenario 2:
    1. an attacker calls `CardTopupPermit` and sends USDC to `HardenedTopupProxy`;
    1. the bridge calldata parameter contains a call that deposits tokens to the bridge and sets destination address to an address controlled by the attacker;
    1. the bridge calldata also has a different amount of tokens: the amount the attacker sent + [the fees accumulated on `HardenedTopupProxy`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L319);
    1. the attacker receives their USDC on a L1 bridge + the fees stolen from `HardenedTopupProxy`.

## Recommendation
1. Limit the scope of the calls tha can be made to the Synapse bridge (allow only certain call signatures).
1. Validate the calldata passed to the Synapse bridge to ensure that mandatory parameters are set correctly.
