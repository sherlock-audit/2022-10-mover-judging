# Malicious tokens can safeTransferFrom() results

## Summary
Malicious tokens can safeTransferFrom() results
## Vulnerability Detail
In the CardTopupPermit() function, _token is passed in by the user and can be a malicious ERC20 token forged by the attacker
```solidity
    function CardTopupPermit(address _token, uint256 _amount, bytes calldata _permit, uint256 _expectedMinimumReceived, bytes memory _convertData, uint256 _bridgeType, bytes memory _bridgeTxData, bytes32 _receiverHash) public payable {
        // this snippet is borrowed from 1inch contracts
        // but encodeWithSelector is replaced with encodePacked (how it worked in their code?) https://github.com/1inch/1inch-v2-contracts/blob/v2.1/contracts/OneInchExchange.sol#L173
        if (_permit.length == 32 * 7) {
            // solhint-disable-next-line avoid-low-level-calls
            (bool success, /*bytes memory result*/) = address(_token).call(abi.encodePacked(IERC20PermitUpgradeable.permit.selector, _permit));
            if (!success) {
                revert("permit call failed");
            }
        }

        // don't perform allowance check for native token (allowance is n/a in such case, it's provided by tx.value)
        if (_token != ETH_TOKEN_ADDRESS) {
            // we check 'current' allowance after executing permit (not the amount in permit itself)
            checkAllowance(_token, _amount);
        }

        // allowance checks/enforcing complete, perform actual topup (this flow is further unified across 3 possible topup public methods)
        _processTopup(msg.sender, _token, _amount, _expectedMinimumReceived, _convertData, _bridgeType, _bridgeTxData, _receiverHash);
    }
```
The _token is then put into the _processTopup function
```solidity
    function _processTopup(address _beneficiary, address _token, uint256 _amount, uint256 _expectedMinimumReceived, bytes memory _convertData, uint256 _bridgeType, bytes memory _bridgeTxData, bytes32 _receiverHash) internal
    {
        // don't go further is contract function is paused (by admin or pauser)
        require(paused == false, "operations paused");

       
        // conversion is required, perform swap through exchangeProxy
        if (_token != ETH_TOKEN_ADDRESS) {
            // transfer tokens on the exchange proxy balance before performing swap call
            IERC20Upgradeable(_token).safeTransferFrom(_beneficiary, address(exchangeProxyContract), _amount);
        }
```
Here, a malicious _token can implement a fake safeTransferFrom function, such as no transfer but return a successful transfer. The contract also does not check the soundness of _token. Cause loss of contracted assets.

        _processTopup(msg.sender, _token, _amount, _expectedMinimumReceived, _convertData, _bridgeType, _bridgeTxData, _receiverHash);
