# Manipulation of setTopupFee

## Summary
setTopupFee will frontrun the user's _processTopup process, so that the tokens received by the user may be much smaller than expected
## Vulnerability Detail
Admin can setTopupFee up to 100%. This is bad for users, topupFee should have a reasonable upper limit, e.g. 10% to prevent potential griefing.
And setTopupFee will frontrun the user's _processTopup process, so that the tokens received by the user may be much smaller than expected (When the token is cardTopupToken there is no slippage control, in other cases the slippage control will not work due to the following code)
```solidity
        require(amountReceived >= _expectedMinimumReceived, "minimum swap amount not met");

        // fee is deducted in receiving token (USDC)
        if (topupFee != 0) {
            uint256 feeAmount = amountReceived.mul(topupFee).div(1e18);
            amountReceived = amountReceived.sub(feeAmount);
        }
```

## Impact
setTopupFee will frontrun the user's _processTopup process, so that the tokens received by the user may be much smaller than expected
