# NO STORAGE GAP FOR UPGRADEABLE CONTRACTS

## Summary
For SafeAllowanceResetUpgradeable, which are upgradeable abstract contracts, inheriting contracts may introduce new variables. In order to be able to add new variables to the upgradeable abstract contract without causing storage collisions, a storage gap should be added to the upgradeable abstract contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
If no storage gap is added, when the upgradable abstract contract introduces new variables, it may override the variables in the inheriting contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a storage gap at the end of the upgradeable abstract contract
    
          'uint256[50] private __gap;'
