# M-04 Hardcoded Slippage allows front-running for Synapse Bridge

## Summary

While an hardcoded slippage is better than no-slippage, understand that 5% slippage is pretty lax and is a pretty juicy MEV opportunity.

A tighter slippage, or rather a check to enforce that `_data` contains slippage would allow for customizability while giving stronger security guarantees.

## Vulnerability Detail

Because the slippage is hardcoded at 5%, MEV searches will have a clear arbitrage.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider hardcoding a tighter slippage (1%, especially on polygon)
Or allow the caller to specify a slippage within range and default to 5% in case they do not
