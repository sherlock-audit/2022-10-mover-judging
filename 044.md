# Missing ReEntrancy Guard to `executeSwapDirect` function

## Summary
There is no re-entry risk on true ERC-20 tokens that work according to the spec (i.e. audited, etc.).

However you can write a malicious ERC-20 with custom safetransferFrom() or approve() that have re-entrancy hooks to attack a target.

Furthermore ERC-777 is backwards compatible token standard with ERC-20 standard. ERC-777 has better usability, but it has transfer hooks that can cause re-entrancy.

## Vulnerability Detail
**[openzeppelin's view on the reentrancy problem ](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/safeerc20-sol-safetransfer-reentrancy/29132/3)**

ERC20 generally doesn't result in reentrancy, however ERC777 tokens can and they can maskerade as ERC20. So if a contract interacts with unknown ERC20 tokens it is better to be safe and consider that transfers can create reentrancy problems.




## Impact
Although reentrancy attack is considered quite old over the past two years, there have been cases such as:

- Uniswap/LendfMe hacks (2020) ($25 mln, attacked by a hacker using a reentrancy)

- The BurgerSwap hack (May 2021) ( $7.2 million because of a fake token contract and a reentrancy exploit.)

- The SURGEBNB hack (August 2021)  ($4 million seems to be a reentrancy-based price manipulation attack.)

- CREAM FINANCE hack (August 2021)  ($18.8 million, reentrancy vulnerability allowed the exploiter for the second borrow.)

- Siren protocol hack (September 2021)  ($3.5 million, AMM pools were exploited through reentrancy attack.)


Type of Reentrancy

[Details](https://inspexco.medium.com/cross-contract-reentrancy-attack-402d27a02a15)
1 - Single Function Reentrancy
2 - Cross-Function Reentrancy
3 - Cross-Contract Reentrancy

## Code Snippet

Must be re-entrancy guard to below functions
```js

cardtopup_contract/contracts/ExchangeProxy.sol:
   90       */
   91:     function executeSwap(
   92:         address _tokenFrom,
   93:         address _tokenTo,
   94:         uint256 _amount,
   95:         bytes memory _data
   96:     ) public payable override returns (uint256) {
   97:         // native token doesn't need to be transferred explicitly, it's in tx.value
   98:         if (_tokenFrom != ETH_TOKEN_ADDRESS) {
   99:             IERC20(_tokenFrom).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
  100:         }
  101:         // after token is transferred to this contract, call actual swap
  102:         return executeSwapDirect(msg.sender, _tokenFrom, _tokenTo, _amount, 0, _data);
  103:     }



cardtopup_contract/contracts/ExchangeProxy.sol:
  194  
  195:         if (_tokenTo != ETH_TOKEN_ADDRESS) {
  196:             //send received tokens to beneficiary directly
  197:             IERC20(_tokenTo).safeTransfer(_beneficiary, amountReceived);
  198:         } else {
  199:             //send received eth to beneficiary directly
  200:             payable(_beneficiary).sendValue(amountReceived);
  201:             // payable(_beneficiary).transfer(amountReceived);
  202:             // should work for external wallets (currently is the case)
  203:             // but wont work for some other smart contracts due to gas stipend limit
  204          }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use Openzeppelin or Solmate Re-Entrancy  pattern

Here is a example of a re-entracy guard
```js

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract ReEntrancyGuard {
    bool internal locked;

    modifier noReentrant() {
        require(!locked, "No re-entrancy");
        locked = true;
        _;
        locked = false;
    }
}

```
