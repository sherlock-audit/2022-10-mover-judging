# TODO M-03 Blockhash doesn't work for current block

## Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L1058-L1059

```solidity
        bytes32 blockHash = blockhash(_blockNumber);

```

Should check that block provided is less than current as the current blockHash cannot be known

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

## Code Snippet

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.10;

contract MoverTests {
  function prooveBlockhash(uint256 blockNumberDelta, bytes32 expected) external {
    uint256 blockTarget = block.number - blockNumberDelta;
    require(expected == blockhash(blockTarget), "Hash is not expected");
  }
}
```

If the value was non-zero we'd get a revert

```python
>>> c.prooveBlockhash(0, 0, {"from": a[0]})
Transaction sent: 0x3a9d4c6aab7c94651a2176fdd75ea3ead6cc7f94408b34bfa480a26f090d5769

>>>
```

However we do not, meaning a 0 blockhash will be provided

Prevent using current block
