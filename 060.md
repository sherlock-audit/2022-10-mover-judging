# Anyone can steal fee in ExchangeProxy to do the swap

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/ExchangeProxy.sol#L173-L175

## Vulnerability Detail

In `ExchangeProxy.executeSwapDirect(...)` function, user can pass in arbitrary `_data`. It's not validated to make sure this swap used exactly `_amount` tokenIn. In addition, fee of previous swaps is kept in ExchangeProxy. So attacker can steal these fee to do the swap.

## Impact
Anyone can steal fee in ExchangeProxy

## Code Snippet

Input token is transferred to ExchangeProxy contract before calling this function. 

```solidity
// ensure no state passed, no reentrancy, etc.
(bool success, ) = executorAddress.call{value: ethValue}(callData); // @audit can take fee of this contract to swap
require(success, "SWAP_CALL_FAILED");
```

Allowance to spender will be maxInt
```solidity
// allow spender to transfer tokens from this contract
if (_tokenFrom != ETH_TOKEN_ADDRESS && spenderAddress != address(0)) {
    require(trustedRegistryContract.isWhitelisted(spenderAddress), "allowance to non-trusted");
    resetAllowanceIfNeeded(IERC20(_tokenFrom), spenderAddress, _amount);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider transferring fee immediately after the swap. This contract is not supposed to hold any funds.
