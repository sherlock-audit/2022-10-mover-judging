# Fee-on-transfer tokens are not supported

## Summary
The protocoll will fail to exchange FoT tokens, because transfered amount is often less than received.
## Vulnerability Detail
Plenty of ERC20 tokens charge a fee for every transfer (e.g. Safemoon and its forks), in which the amount of token received is less than the amount being sent. When a fee token is used as the `_token` in the `_processTopup()` function, the amount received by the contract would be less than the amount being sent.
Let's assume that `_amount` is 100.
After transfer
```solidity
cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol
331:             IERC20Upgradeable(_token).safeTransferFrom(_beneficiary, address(exchangeProxyContract), _amount);
```
We receive for example 95.
However we tell our Exchange proxy to swap 100:
```solidity
cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol
335:         uint256 amountReceived =
336:             IExchangeProxy(address(exchangeProxyContract)).executeSwapDirect{value: msg.value}(
337:                 address(this),
338:                 _token,
339:                 cardTopupToken,
340:                 _amount,//@audit fee on transfer may fail or use accumulated fees to proceed
341:                 exchangeFee,
342:                 _convertData
343:             );
```
When it calls an exchange, exchange will try to transferFrom our contract 100, but we only have 95, so it will fail, or use some tokens transfered before for some reason.
## Impact
FoT tokens are not supported. Or just drained if such tokens were provided by someone.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check how many tokens are actually received
```diff
cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol
+	uint balanceBefore = IERC20Upgradeable(_token).balanceOf(address(exchangeProxyContract));
331:   IERC20Upgradeable(_token).safeTransferFrom(_beneficiary, address(exchangeProxyContract), _amount);
+   	uint balanceAfter = IERC20Upgradeable(_token).balanceOf(address(exchangeProxyContract));
+   	uint received = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
```
and then
```diff
cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol
335:         uint256 amountReceived =
336:             IExchangeProxy(address(exchangeProxyContract)).executeSwapDirect{value: msg.value}(
337:                 address(this),
338:                 _token,
339:                 cardTopupToken,
- 340:                 _amount,
+ 340:                 received,
341:                 exchangeFee,
342:                 _convertData
343:             );
```
