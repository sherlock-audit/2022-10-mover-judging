# ECRECOVER() NOT CHECKED FOR SIGNER ADDRESS OF ZERO

## Summary
ECRECOVER() NOT CHECKED FOR SIGNER ADDRESS OF ZERO
## Vulnerability Detail
ECRECOVER() NOT CHECKED FOR SIGNER ADDRESS OF ZERO
## Impact
The ecrecover() function returns an address of zero when the signature does not match. This can cause problems if address zero is ever the owner of assets, and someone uses the permit function on address zero. If that happens, any invalid signature will pass the checks, and the assets will be stealable. In this case, the asset of concern is the vault’s ERC20 token, and fortunately OpenZeppelin’s implementation does a good job of making sure that address zero is never able to have a positive balance. If this contract ever changes to another ERC20 implementation that is laxer in its checks in favor of saving gas, this code may become a problem.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L460-L484
```solidity
    function recoverSigner(bytes32 message, bytes memory sig) internal pure returns (address)
    {
        // signature is expected to be exactly 65 bytes (2 * 32 byte words and a checksum)
        require(sig.length == 65, "invalid sig length");

        // signature components
        bytes32 r;
        bytes32 s;
        uint8 v;
        assembly {
            // first 32 bytes, after the length prefix
            r := mload(add(sig, 32))
            // second 32 bytes
            s := mload(add(sig, 64))
            // final byte (first byte of the next 32 bytes)
            v := byte(0, mload(add(sig, 96)))
        }

        // Version of signature should be 27 or 28, but 0 and 1 are also possible versions
        if (v < 27) {
            v += 27;
        }

        return ecrecover(message, v, r, s);
    }
```

## Recommendation
```solidity
address signer = recoverSigner(message, _signature);
require(signer != address(0));
```
