# Incompatability with deflationary / fee-on-transfer tokens

## Summary

function _processTopup would bridge failed handling the fee-on-transfer token because it uses the _amount user passed in for bridging instruction instead of the actual amount received.

## Vulnerability Detail

The comment suggests that token other than USDC may be used.

```solidity
    // card topup token is planned to be USDC (or chain equivalent), but can be changed by admin at any time
    function setCardTopupToken(address _topupToken) public onlyAdmin {
        cardTopupToken = _topupToken;
    }
```

the code below in  HardenedTopupProxy.sol#_processTop is not compatible with fee-on-transfer token

```solidity
if (_token == cardTopupToken) {
    // beneficiary is msg.sender (perform static check)
    IERC20Upgradeable(_token).safeTransferFrom(_beneficiary, address(this), _amount);

    uint256 feeAmount = _amount.mul(topupFee).div(1e18);

    // bridge from _beneficiary to card L1 relay
    _bridgeAssetDirect(_amount.sub(feeAmount), _bridgeType, _bridgeTxData);

    emit CardTopup(_beneficiary, _token, _amount, _amount.sub(feeAmount), _receiverHash);
    return;
}
```

for example, if user pass in 100 _amount, expect 1% of the topupFee, however, if the underlying token charge transfer fee,

after 

```solidity
IERC20Upgradeable(_token).safeTransferFrom(_beneficiary, address(this), _amount);
```

actually, 95 amount of token is received, but we are still using the original amount - fee, which is 99 in this case  in bridging instruction.

```solidity
_bridgeAssetDirect(_amount.sub(feeAmount), _bridgeType, _bridgeTxData);
```

## Impact

Bridging will have issues when handling fee-on-transfer token.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the project check the actual balance received inside the case when token == cardTopupToken
