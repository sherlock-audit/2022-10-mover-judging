# Lack for sanity check while setting the exchangeProxyContract, trustedRegistryContract could cause the protocol to misbehave.

## Summary
Admin is allowed to set the exchangeProxyContract, trustedRegistryContract which are the major address that the protocol depend.
But there are no check to verify that the addresses are valid or not.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L175-L181
In above line of codes, the admin is setting the exchangeProxyContract, trustedRegistryContract address without validating.
If user error happens and by mistake it is set to zero address, this could affect the functioning of protocol and loses to both user and to the protocol.

## Impact
        // conversion is required, perform swap through exchangeProxy
        if (_token != ETH_TOKEN_ADDRESS) {
            // transfer tokens on the exchange proxy balance before performing swap call
            IERC20Upgradeable(_token).safeTransferFrom(_beneficiary, address(exchangeProxyContract), _amount);
        }

        // exchange proxy is trusted and would check swap provider on its own in trusted registry contract
        uint256 amountReceived =
            IExchangeProxy(address(exchangeProxyContract)).executeSwapDirect{value: msg.value}(
                address(this),
                _token,
                cardTopupToken,
                _amount,
                exchangeFee,
                _convertData
            );
Above line of codes will misbehave during the transaction.

        // call method is very powerful, as it allows to call anything pretending to be the topup proxy
        // so we protect ourserves by allowing only the addresses we add to allowlist
        require(trustedRegistryContract.isWhitelisted(targetAddress), "call to non-trusted");

In above line of codes, the trusted registry can not evaluate.

This could be simple one, but if it happens, this can cause major impact in short span of time.

## Recommendation

Validate addresses before setting them.
