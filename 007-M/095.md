# There is no limit on the amount of fee (including exchange fee and top-up fee) users have to pay

## Summary

There is no limit on the amount of fee (including exchange fee and top-up fee) users have to pay.

User's recipient amount may be slashed a lot if the compromised admin charge a large amount of fee.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation, if a user want to bridge using the cardTopupToken, he needs to pay a topup fee, 

```solidity
if (_token == cardTopupToken) {
    // beneficiary is msg.sender (perform static check)
    IERC20Upgradeable(_token).safeTransferFrom(_beneficiary, address(this), _amount);

    uint256 feeAmount = _amount.mul(topupFee).div(1e18);

    // bridge from _beneficiary to card L1 relay
    _bridgeAssetDirect(_amount.sub(feeAmount), _bridgeType, _bridgeTxData);

    emit CardTopup(_beneficiary, _token, _amount, _amount.sub(feeAmount), _receiverHash);
    return;
}
```

if the user wants to bridge but not using a cardTopupToken, the token first is swapped to the topup token.

```solidity
uint256 amountReceived =
IExchangeProxy(address(exchangeProxyContract)).executeSwapDirect{value: msg.value}(
    address(this),
    _token,
    cardTopupToken,
    _amount,
    exchangeFee,
    _convertData
);
```

the user needs to pay exchangeFee in ExchangeProxy.sol

```solidity
amountReceived = amountReceived.sub(
    amountReceived.mul(_exchangeFee).div(1e18)
);
```

there is no upper limit of the parameter setting exchangeFee and topupFee. The admin can charge the fee to any number

```solidity
function setTopupFee(uint256 _topupFee) public onlyAdmin {
    topupFee = _topupFee;
    emit FeeChanged("topup", _topupFee);
}

function setExchangeFee(uint256 _exchangeFee) public onlyAdmin {
    exchangeFee = _exchangeFee;
    emit FeeChanged("exchange", _exchangeFee);
}
```

An EOA account can set a very high number of topup fee and exchange fee as such 1e18, then user's fund get slash by paying the fee before the bridging instruction.

## Impact

then the user's fund gets slashed by paying a large amount of the fee before the bridging instruction.

## Recommendation

We Consider adding an upper limit on the number of fee users need to pay.
