# No validation in fee boundries

## Summary
No fee validation is made during setting the fees which can cause loss of funds for the users.
## Vulnerability Detail
HardenedTopupProxy contract has  `setTopupFee` and `setExchangeFee` functions to set the fees under admin privilage.
However, there is no validation carried out while setting those. The fees should be in between boundries to prevent human error and loss of user funds due to this. E.g., the intention is to set the new fee to 10% but it ends up with setting it to 100%. 

Recently Optimism Governance tokens yearly inflation rate is mistakenly set to 20% instead of 2%.

## Impact
Loss of user funds
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function setExchangeFee(uint256 _exchangeFee) public onlyAdmin {
        exchangeFee = _exchangeFee;
        emit FeeChanged("exchange", _exchangeFee);
    }
```
```solidity
    function setTopupFee(uint256 _topupFee) public onlyAdmin {
        topupFee = _topupFee;
        emit FeeChanged("topup", _topupFee);
    }
```
