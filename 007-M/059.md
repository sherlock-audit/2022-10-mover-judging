# Malicious admin can rug the user's topups & swaps

## Summary
The `HardenedTopupProxy` admin controls the topup fee and the exchange fee and can set them to any value, any time.

## Vulnerability Detail
A compromised or a malicious admin can set both fees to 100%, essentially rugging all users of the protocol - they will lose all of their money to the owner. This is a common centralisation risk, that can be mitigated without too much effort.

## Impact
The impact is 100% loss of user funds in the case of a compromised or a malicious admin

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add an upper limit for both fees, like 10 or 15% and add a require statements that will revert if the new fee is more than the limit.
