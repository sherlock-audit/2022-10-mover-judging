# Fee amount is not clear and can be changed in any moment for any value

## Summary
There is no any checkings for the fees that are used through the protocol.
## Vulnerability Detail
Mover collects [fees](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L90-L92) for exchanging tokens and bridging them. It's possible for admin to [set](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L199-L207) both those variables. However there is no any checks, so admin can provide any value. 

## Impact
Admin can change fees to any value.

## Recommendation
Add some bounds for the fee amount. Or at least check that it's not more than 100%.
