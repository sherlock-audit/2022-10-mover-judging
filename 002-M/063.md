# Signature replay

## Summary

The `CardTopupMPTProof()` function verifies the signatures for authorization. However, signature without nonce is susceptible to replay vulnerability.


## Vulnerability Detail

The `SignedTransaction` does not contain nonce, so the same signature could be reused. If the user mistakenly submitted the transaction multiple times, or due to network problem or congestions, the fund could be transferred unexpected.


## Impact

Users funds could be transferred multiple times by the same signature submission, but not expected by the user.
