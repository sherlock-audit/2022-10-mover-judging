# Use of ecrecover opens up protocol to signature replay attack

## Summary
Message signed does not contain anything that prevents reuse of the same signature. This opens up the protocol to signature replay attack for when signer is used to verify a transaction.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the message, `bytes32 message = constructMsg(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender)), _token, _amount, _timestamp)`, it contains only the address of `msg.sender`, token address, `_amount` and `_timestamp`, none of which can prevent the attacker from using the same signature multiple times, as long as different transactions are made in the same block so `_timestamp` remains the same.

## Impact
`CardTopupTrusted()` relies on the signature to verify that a user is allowed to make a top up after receiving approval by a trusted party. This can allow a user to make more top ups than he is allowed to which may create problems if the trusted party only allows user to top up once.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A nonce should be used as part of the message to prevent such an attack. However, use of OpenZeppelin's ECDSA library is recommended which includes many other important checks.
