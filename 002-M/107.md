# Nonce should be used to prevent signature and MPT proof reuse

## Summary
Nonce should be used to prevent signature and MPT proof reuse

## Vulnerability Detail

Currently, signature and MPT proof only prevent reuse by using timestamp or block number differences. But that doesn't enough, the signature can be submitted multiple times in the same block too. So, timestamp and block number differences are zero.

## Impact
Signatures and MPT proof can be reused causing a severe double spending issue.
