# Reuse of the signature for CardTopupTrusted

## Summary

Reusability of signature provided for calling `CardTopupTrusted` function.

## Severity

High

## Vulnerability Detail

There is `CardTopupTrusted` function in `HardenedTopupProxy` contract. It accepts the signature provided by the trusted executor EOA and a few other parameters including signature timestamp `_timestamp`.

There is the following part of this function that stated to protect signature from reuse:

```solidity=
// if signature is old, don't accept it to avoid reuse and ensure approval was fresh
// trusted executor won't produce messages with timestamps in the future
require(block.timestamp - _timestamp < allowanceSignatureTimespan, "old sig");
```

But in practice, such a signature can be reused even in the same block (obviously with the same `block.timestamp` value). So there is no actual protection against the reuse of the signature inside of this function.

## Impact

A user that received from trusted executor EOA a signature for calling `CardTopupTrusted` function can reuse it until it is expired according to the timestamp-related logic.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding a special `nonce` field to the message and protection against the reuse of the signature. As an example, you can do the following:

```solidity=
function constructMsg(bytes32 _addrhash, address _token, uint256 _amount, uint256 _timestamp, uint256 _nonce) internal pure returns (bytes32) {
    return keccak256(abi.encodePacked("MOVER TOPUP ", _addrhash, " TOKEN ", _token, " AMOUNT ", _amount, " TS ", _timestamp, " NONCE ", _nonce));
}

mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => bool)) usedNonce;

function CardTopupTrusted(address _token, uint256 _amount, uint256 _timestamp, uint256 _nonce, bytes calldata _signature, uint256 _expectedMinimumReceived, bytes memory _convertData, uint256 _bridgeType, bytes memory _bridgeTxData, bytes32 _receiverHash) public {
    // reconstruct message from the data used for topup to ensure it matches provided information
    bytes32 message = constructMsg(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender)), _token, _amount, _timestamp, _nonce);
        
    // recover signer which must be trusted executor EOA
    address signer = recoverSigner(message, _signature);
    require(hasRole(TRUSTED_EXETUTOR_ROLE, signer), "wrong signature");
    
    require(!usedNonce[signer][_nonce], "signature reuse");
    usedNonce[signer][_nonce] = true;
    
    ...
}
```

Also, there is no protection of usage signature from one chain for the same purposes on the other chain. It is good practice to add to the message `block.chainid`.
