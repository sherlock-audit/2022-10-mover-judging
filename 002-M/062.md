# `ecrecover` is vulnerable to signature malleability and can also return the zero address for the signer

## Summary
`ecrecover` 
EVM's `ecrecover` is susceptible to signature malleability which allows replay attacks.
See reference:Â [https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-117](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-117)
Also, `ecrecover` by specification returns the zero address for an incorrect signature, but the code is not checked for this behaviour.

## Vulnerability Detail
Vulnerability No1 is replay attacks because of signature malleability - a signature can be used more than once.
Vulnerability No2 is because of the following 
`        // recover signer which must be trusted executor EOA
        address signer = recoverSigner(message, _signature);
        require(hasRole(TRUSTED_EXETUTOR_ROLE, signer), "wrong signature");`
If `recoverSigner()` which uses `ecrecover` returns the zero address here, and for some reason the zero address was given the `TRUSTED_EXETUTOR_ROLE`, then this check will just pass without reverting. This will allow the attacker to create malicious signatures and steal user funds.

## Impact
Both vulnerabilities can result in stealing user funds because of wrong `ecrecover` checks.

## Recommendation
Use OpenZeppelin's ECDSA library for extra added checks and to mitigate the signature malleability vulnerability when checking the signer
