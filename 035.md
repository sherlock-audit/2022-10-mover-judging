# `cardPartnerAddress` and `allowanceSignatureTimespan` aren't initialized in the constructor in HardenedTopupProxy.sol

## Summary
`cardPartnerAddress` and `allowanceSignatureTimespan` aren't initialized in the constructor. If the admin were to unpause the contract without initializing these variables, it could lead to early users losing funds and for `HardenedTopupProxy.CardTopupTrusted` not to be usable.

## Vulnerability Detail
Both variables `cardPartnerAddress` and `allowanceSignatureTimespan` aren't initialized in the constructor. The admin could unpaused the contract without initializing them.
`cardPartnerAddress` is the L1 Eth address for card topup settlement, therefore if this variable is not initialized early users would send funds to `address(0)` on L1.
`allowanceSignatureTimespan` is allowance max signature age, therefore if this variable is not initialized the `HardenedTopupProxy.CardTopupTrusted` would always revert.

## Impact
- Early users would be sending their funds to `address(0)` on L1 if `cardPartnerAddress` isn't initialized.
- `HardenedTopupProxy.CardTopupTrusted` would be unusable if `allowanceSignatureTimespan` isn't initialized

I think this issue represent a Medium Risk and not a High Risk, because the admin could pause the contract or update the variables when
the issue is discovered. Especially, I think it still represent a Medium Risk because this is a possible state of the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend initializing these variables to a trusted default address for `cardPartnerAddress` and to a reasonable default amount of time for `allowanceSignatureTimespan`.
