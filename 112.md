# Attacker can steal the accumulated topup fees in the `topupproxy` contract's balance

## Summary

The accumulated fees in the `topupproxy` contract's balance can be stolen by an attacker by using malicious `_bridgeTxData` and using `1inch`'s as `targetAddress`.

## Vulnerability Detail

This attack vector is enabled by multiple traits of the `topupproxy` contract:

#### 1. Shared whitelist

Per to deploy script, the same `trustedregistry` will be shared among `exchangeproxy` and `topupproxy`.

Therefore, the 2 whitelisted swap aggregator contracts will also be allowed to be called on `topupproxy`:

- 0x Proxy
- 1inch Proxy

And the 2 whitelisted bridge contracts can be called on `exchangeproxy`:

- Synapse
- Across

#### 2. Unlimited allowance rather than only the amount of the current topup to the bridge's `targetAddress`

At L414, the `targetAddress` will be granted an unlimited allowance rather than just the amount of the current transaction.

#### 3. `1inch` can be used to pull an arbitrary amount of funds from the caller and execute arbitrary call

The design of `1inch`'s `AggregationRouterV4` can be used to pull funds from the `topupproxy` and execute arbitrary external call:

See L2309-2321.

#### 4. The topup fee will be left in the contract's balance

---

Combining all the 3 above together, the attacker can call `CardTopupPermit() -> _processTopup() -> 1inch#swap()` and drain all the funds in the contract:

- _token: cardTopupToken
- _bridgeType: 0
- _bridgeTxData:
    - targetAddress: 1inch Proxy
    - callData:
        - amount: all the topupproxy's balance
        - srcReceiver: attacker's address


## Impact

All the accumulated fees can be stolen by the attacker.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. The accumulated fees should not be left in the contract;
2. Only give the whitelisted `targetAddress` the allowance of the amount (`_amount`) transferred into the `topupproxy` contract within this transaction from the caller;
2. The whitelist should not be shared.
