# The Protocol calculate fee based on 18 decimal precision value. This can not be applied for all tokens

## Summary
The protocol calculates fees based on 18 decimal place precision. This can not be applied for the tokens that do not have 18 decimal precision.

## Vulnerability Detail
When look at the code, the fees are calculated by assuming that all tokens could have 18 decimal precision.
But, some of the tokens have decimal value lesser than or greater than 18. For example, for USDT, it is 6 decimal precision.
For these ty

## Impact
The calculated fee is not correct for tokens that does not have 18 decimal places.
