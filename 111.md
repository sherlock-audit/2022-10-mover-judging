# `topupFee` and `exchangeFee` should have upper limits.

## Summary
`topupFee` and `exchangeFee` should have upper limits.

## Vulnerability Detail
`topupFee` and `exchangeFee` are used to charge fees during the exchange and all topups.

At the first time, they are both 0 but the admin can change them to any value even 100% anytime.

```solidity
    function setTopupFee(uint256 _topupFee) public onlyAdmin {
        topupFee = _topupFee;
        emit FeeChanged("topup", _topupFee);
    }

    function setExchangeFee(uint256 _exchangeFee) public onlyAdmin {
        exchangeFee = _exchangeFee;
        emit FeeChanged("exchange", _exchangeFee);
    }
```

Especially, with the `topupFee`, it's charged after checking the [_expectedMinimumReceived requirement](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L348-L352) so the admin can front run and charge almost 100% of funds as a fee.

```solidity
    // this is sanity check from the client if the swap misbehaves
    require(amountReceived >= _expectedMinimumReceived, "minimum swap amount not met");

    // fee is deducted in receiving token (USDC)
    if (topupFee != 0) {
        uint256 feeAmount = amountReceived.mul(topupFee).div(1e18);
        amountReceived = amountReceived.sub(feeAmount);
    }
```

## Impact
Users would be forced to pay more fees than they want.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommend adding upper limits of fees like 10% for the protocol's reputation.
