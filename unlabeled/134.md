# Reuse of the same input parameters in CardTopupMPTProof

## Summary

Reusability of the same input parameters when calling `CardTopupMPTProof` function.

## Severity

High

## Vulnerability Detail

There is `CardTopupMPTProof` function in `HardenedTopupProxy` contract. It accepts the proof to verify that transaction provided and a few other parameters.

In practice, there is no protection against the reuse of the proof of inclusion of the same transaction.

## Impact

A user that is expected to use `CardTopupTrusted` function can reuse the same input data (including proof of the transaction inclusion) until it is expired according to the blocknumber-related logic (as there is no possibility to access hashes of the blocks with `_blockNumber <= block.number - 256`).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding special protection against the reuse of the proof of the inclusion of the same transaction.
