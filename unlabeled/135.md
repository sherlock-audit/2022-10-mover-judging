# Invalid logic of checkApprove when input data is not long enough

## Summary

`checkApprove` assembly logic is incorrect in the case when `txdata` bytes array is not long enough.

## Severity

High

## Vulnerability Detail

There is `checkApprove` function in `HardenedTopupProxy` contract. It should check that txdata matches ERC20 approve method signature and that the spender is this contract's address. It does read the data inside the inline assembly and checks that data is expected. However, the check for the data length is missing. So, in the case when the length of `txdata` is shorter than `4 + 32` bytes logic of `checkApprove` function from `assembly` construction will be completely incorrect: it will try to `mload` data from the memory that does not correspond to the `txdata` array.

## Impact

Reading data that do not correspond to the `txdata` bytes array, using such data as expected data of `txdata`, and, as result, an incorrect result of `checkApprove` function.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding a special check on the length of `txdata` bytes array to the start of `checkApprove` function:

```solidity
function checkApprove(bytes memory txdata) view internal {
    require(txdata.length >= ???, "txdata is too short");
    
    ...
}
```
