# Lacking slippage check in ExchangeProxy

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/ExchangeProxy.sol#L131

Lacking slippage check will make this function vulnerable to front-running attack. Users using this function to swap may lose funds - get lower output amount than expected.

## Vulnerability Detail

Function `executeSwapDirect()` helps user swap with an arbitrary data generated off-chain. In the comment, it said that 
>  -- this contract would perform check for expected minimum amount
              -- this contract performs call operation with arbitrary data:
                 -- no reentrancy;
                 -- this contract is a layer of security and does not have abilities except swap

However, there is no line in the codebase to check for expected minimum amount. The result is swap can be front-running, making users in loss.

## Impact
Loss of funds for users doing swap.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function executeSwapDirect(
    address _beneficiary,
    address _tokenFrom,
    address _tokenTo,
    uint256 _amount,
    uint256 _exchangeFee,
    bytes memory _data
) public payable override returns (uint256) {
    require(msg.sender == transferProxyAddress, "transfer proxy only");

    // extract values from bytes array provided
    address executorAddress;
    address spenderAddress;
    uint256 ethValue;

    bytes memory callData = ByteUtil.slice(_data, 72, _data.length - 72);
    assembly {
        executorAddress := mload(add(_data, add(0x14, 0)))
        spenderAddress := mload(add(_data, add(0x14, 0x14)))
        ethValue := mload(add(_data, add(0x20, 0x28)))
    }

    // allow spender to transfer tokens from this contract
    if (_tokenFrom != ETH_TOKEN_ADDRESS && spenderAddress != address(0)) {
        require(trustedRegistryContract.isWhitelisted(spenderAddress), "allowance to non-trusted");
        resetAllowanceIfNeeded(IERC20(_tokenFrom), spenderAddress, _amount);
    }

    // remember the actual balance of target token (fees could reside on this contract balance)
    uint256 balanceBefore = 0;
    if (_tokenTo != ETH_TOKEN_ADDRESS) {
        balanceBefore = IERC20(_tokenTo).balanceOf(address(this));
    } else {
        balanceBefore = address(this).balance;
    }

    // regardless of stated amount, the ETH value passed to exchange call must be provided to the contract
    require(msg.value >= ethValue, "insufficient ETH provided");

    // don't allow to call non-trusted addresses
    require(trustedRegistryContract.isWhitelisted(executorAddress), "call to non-trusted");

    // ensure no state passed, no reentrancy, etc.
    (bool success, ) = executorAddress.call{value: ethValue}(callData);
    require(success, "SWAP_CALL_FAILED");

    // always rely only on actual amount received regardless of called parameters
    uint256 amountReceived = 0;
    if (_tokenTo != ETH_TOKEN_ADDRESS) {
        amountReceived = IERC20(_tokenTo).balanceOf(address(this));
    } else {
        amountReceived = address(this).balance;
    }
    amountReceived = amountReceived.sub(balanceBefore);

    require(amountReceived > 0, "zero amount received");

    // process exchange fee if present (in deposit we get pool tokens, so process fees after swap, here we take fees in source token)
    // fees are left on this contract address and are harvested by yield distributor
    //uint256 feeAmount = amountReceived.mul(_exchangeFee).div(1e18);
    amountReceived = amountReceived.sub(
        amountReceived.mul(_exchangeFee).div(1e18)
    ); // this is return value that should reflect actual result of swap (for deposit, etc.)

    if (_tokenTo != ETH_TOKEN_ADDRESS) {
        //send received tokens to beneficiary directly
        IERC20(_tokenTo).safeTransfer(_beneficiary, amountReceived);
    } else {
        //send received eth to beneficiary directly
        payable(_beneficiary).sendValue(amountReceived);
        // payable(_beneficiary).transfer(amountReceived);
        // should work for external wallets (currently is the case)
        // but wont work for some other smart contracts due to gas stipend limit
    } // @audit no check for minimum amount

    emit ExecuteSwap(_beneficiary, _tokenFrom, _tokenTo, _amount, amountReceived);
    
    // amount received is used to check minimal amount condition set by calling app from topup proxy contract
    return amountReceived;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding `minAmountOut` params and check for it in `executeSwapDirect(...)` function.
