# Synapse Bridge: Calldata with different to address can be provided

## Summary
When the synapse bridge is used, it is not verified that the funds will be bridged to the `cardPartnerAddress`.

## Vulnerability Detail
For the synapse bridge call, arbitrary call data can be provided:
```solidity
            // Synapse bridge call data is retrieved by performing a call by the application
            // to bridge SDK and is not transformed by this contract
            bytes memory callData = _bridgeTxData.slice(20, _bridgeTxData.length - 20);
            (bool success, ) = targetAddress.call(callData);
```
Usually, this should be the bridge call data that is retrieved from the Synapse SDK where the `addressTo` address is set to `cardPartnerAddress` (such that the funds arrive there). However, this is not validated in the smart contract.

## Impact
An attacker can use the Synapse SDK to craft bridge call data which will result in the bridging of tokens to his address. Because the `CardTopup` event is emitted nevertheless (and this event is what matters for the Mover backend according to the documentation), the system will think that the user has transferred the funds to the `cardPartnerAddress`, which is not true.
