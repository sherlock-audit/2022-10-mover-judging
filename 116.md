# Users might steal the remaining fees inside the `ExchangeProxy` contract after `cardTopupToken` is changed.

## Summary
Users might steal the remaining fees inside the `ExchangeProxy` contract after `cardTopupToken` is changed.

## Vulnerability Detail
This attack is possible when the `ExchangeProxy` contract contains some tokens besides the active fee token (so `cardTopupToken`).

For example, if `cardTopupToken` was changed from `USDC` to `DAI` by admin before withdrawing the remaining `USDC` from the `ExchangeProxy` contract, then any users can steal the stored `USDC` like below.

- At the first time, `cardTopupToken = USDC` and a certain amount of `USDC` was stored inside the `ExchangeProxy` contract by charging the fee.
- As we can see [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L213-L216), it's possible `cardTopupToken` is changed.

```solidity
    // card topup token is planned to be USDC (or chain equivalent), but can be changed by admin at any time
    function setCardTopupToken(address _topupToken) public onlyAdmin {
        cardTopupToken = _topupToken;
    }
```
- The admin changed the `cardTopupToken` from `USDC` to `DAI` but forgot to withdraw the old fees from `ExchangeProxy`.
- After noticing this change, a user can request to exchange from `USDC` to `DAI` with proper parameters.
- In side the `executeSwapDirect()`, it will allow the `USDC` transfer [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/ExchangeProxy.sol#L154-L157).

```solidity
    // allow spender to transfer tokens from this contract
    if (_tokenFrom != ETH_TOKEN_ADDRESS && spenderAddress != address(0)) {
        require(trustedRegistryContract.isWhitelisted(spenderAddress), "allowance to non-trusted");
        resetAllowanceIfNeeded(IERC20(_tokenFrom), spenderAddress, _amount);
    }
```
- As we can see [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/utils/SafeAllowanceReset.sol#L20-L26), the real allowance will be type(uint256).max instead of `_amount`.

```solidity
  function resetAllowanceIfNeeded(IERC20 _token, address _spender, uint256 _amount) internal {
    uint256 allowance = _token.allowance(address(this), _spender);
    if (allowance < _amount) {
      uint256 newAllowance = 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff;
      IERC20(_token).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(_spender), newAllowance.sub(allowance));
    }
  }
```
- So a user can make the [_data](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/ExchangeProxy.sol#L137) to use `_amount + oldFees` instead of `_amount`.
- So it will use all of `_amount + oldFees` during the exchange and a user will receive `DAI` of that amount.

## Impact
Unwithdrawn fees of the old `cardTopupToken` might be lost by any user.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I think there would be 2 methods to improve.

- Withdraw the stored fees before changing the `cardTopupToken` so that there are no other tokens inside the `ExchangeProxy` contract.
- Set the strict allowance without using `type(uint256).max` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/ExchangeProxy.sol#L154-L157).
