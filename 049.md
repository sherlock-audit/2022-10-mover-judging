# TODO DOUBLE CHECK M-02 All the arbitrary data is unchecked against user rugging themselves

## Summary

When using the Synapse Bridge, because of a lack of checks, callers can rug themselves as the data is not validated.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contracts can be used to:
-> Swap and transfer to someone else
-> Bridge and transfer to someone else

All these options can be achieved by adding malicious bytes that are not checked in the contract.

In clear contradiction to:

```solidity
We are assuming that bridge address is stored in trusted contract registry, and thus, even provided
          by capability to pass arbitrary bytes in the call data for the e.g. Synapse bridge, this should
          not provide ability to access or manipulate other users funds in any way.
```

The synapse bridge code, allows to transfer to another recipient, it also allows to have a fee, which may be set to an irrational value (and hidden in the bytecode unintelligible for an end-user)


See Synapse source code below:
https://etherscan.io/address/0x31fe393815822edacbd81c2262467402199efd0d#code#F15#L247

```solidity
  function mint(
    address payable to,
    IERC20Mintable token,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 fee,
    bytes32 kappa
  ) external nonReentrant() whenNotPaused() {
```

Meaning the callData could be made to transfer to an arbitrary recipient or with a high fee

## Recommendation

Add additional checks to ensure that the recipient is the caller
