# Implementation of own signing and verifying mechanism is more dangerous.

## Summary
The protocol is having its own ECDSA signing and verifying mechanism. This could be more  dangerous.
The standard EPI 721 protocol is not considered.

## Vulnerability Detail
I am sharing the some of the useful resources that could be helful to understand the risk of the issue.
https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/cryptography#ECDSA-recover-bytes32-bytes-
https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712

All the above links share the information on the standard EIP 712 implementation.

The mover developer its own sign and verify mechanism. For example, it does not consider the domain separator, nonce and how the hashing should be.

## Impact
This could be a backdoor to many unknow issues.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is strongly recommended to use the well battle tested EIP 712 based implementation.
Kindly refer the openzeppalin implementation. This is majorly used.
This will prevent some unknows issue that the mover is missed to implement.
