# yieldDistributorAddress could be the same as admin

## Summary
`yieldDistributorAddress` field could be the same address than any admin. It could cause fraudulent and steal movements from admins.

## Vulnerability Detail
`yieldDistributorAddress`'s fees could be stolen by admin users in case they decided to set `yieldDistributorAddress` with their own address.

Steps:
Protocol has an original yieldDistributor.
Protocol fees were increased to big amounts.
Admin user set himself as yieldDistributor.
Admin steal fees using `claimFees` method.

Other possible stealing scenario is that admin users take low amounts of money several times. You should have a monitor process (or person) to realize that it is happening.


## Impact
`setYieldDistributor` method must check `_distributorAddress` parameter is not an admin user.
