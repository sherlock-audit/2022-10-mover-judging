# setYieldDistributor doesn't reset allowance for old yield distributor

## Summary
setYieldDistributor doesn't reset allowance for old yield distributor

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
 function setYieldDistributor(address _tokenAddress, address _distributorAddress) public onlyAdmin { 
     yieldDistributorAddress = _distributorAddress; 
     // only yield to be redistributed should be present on this contract in baseAsset (or other tokens if swap fees) 
     // so no access to lp tokens for the funds invested 
     resetAllowanceIfNeeded(IERC20(_tokenAddress), _distributorAddress, ALLOWANCE_SIZE); 
 } 
```

setYieldDistributor only adds allowance to the new _distributorAddress but does not remove allowance from the old yieldDistributorAddress.

## Impact
If the old yieldDistributor is compromised, it can still steal all funds reserved for yield from ExchangeProxy.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Reset allowance of old yieldDistributorAddress to zero before setting a new one.

```solidity
 function setYieldDistributor(address _tokenAddress, address _distributorAddress) public onlyAdmin { 
     IERC20(_tokenAddress).safeApprove(yieldDistributorAddress, 0);
     yieldDistributorAddress = _distributorAddress; 
     // only yield to be redistributed should be present on this contract in baseAsset (or other tokens if swap fees) 
     // so no access to lp tokens for the funds invested 
     resetAllowanceIfNeeded(IERC20(_tokenAddress), _distributorAddress, ALLOWANCE_SIZE); 
 } 
```
