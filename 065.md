# Expected minimum amount received checked before fee is deducted

## Summary

The ```_expectedMinimumReceived``` is not checked after the fee is deducted which could lead to the user receiving less tokens than they expected.

## Vulnerability Detail

The ```_processTopup``` function in ```HardenedTopupProxy.sol``` allows a user to specify the ```_expectedMinimumReceived``` which would revert the topup if the amount received for the user does not reach the minimum. The minimum is only checked right after ```executeSwapDirect``` in ```ExchangeProxy.sol``` is called and does not take the fee deduction into consideration.

## Impact

Since the topupFee is not capped and by default the minAmount is 0, the user might receive a lot less tokens than what they expected. 

## Code Snippet

Below shows the case in ```_processTopup``` when the token to be topped up is the same as ```cardTopupToken```. The expectedMinimuAmount is not checked.
 
[HardenedTopupProxy.sol:_processTopup#L315-L326](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L315-L326)
```solidity
        if (_token == cardTopupToken) {
            // beneficiary is msg.sender (perform static check)
            IERC20Upgradeable(_token).safeTransferFrom(_beneficiary, address(this), _amount);

            uint256 feeAmount = _amount.mul(topupFee).div(1e18);

            // bridge from _beneficiary to card L1 relay
            _bridgeAssetDirect(_amount.sub(feeAmount), _bridgeType, _bridgeTxData);

            emit CardTopup(_beneficiary, _token, _amount, _amount.sub(feeAmount), _receiverHash);
            return;
        }
```

Below shows the case when the token is not the same as ```cardTopupToken```. The expectedMinimuAmount is only checked after the ```executeSwapDirect``` call and not after the fee is deducted.

```solidity
        uint256 amountReceived =
            IExchangeProxy(address(exchangeProxyContract)).executeSwapDirect{value: msg.value}(
                address(this),
                _token,
                cardTopupToken,
                _amount,
                exchangeFee,
                _convertData
            );

        // this is sanity check from the client if the swap misbehaves
        require(amountReceived >= _expectedMinimumReceived, "minimum swap amount not met");

        // fee is deducted in receiving token (USDC)
        if (topupFee != 0) {
            uint256 feeAmount = amountReceived.mul(topupFee).div(1e18);
            amountReceived = amountReceived.sub(feeAmount);
        }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check if the amount received by the user is more than the exepected minimum amount after fee deductions.
