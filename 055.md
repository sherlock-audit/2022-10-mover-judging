# chainId is not checked for Synapse bridging

## Summary

A lack of checks of the data passed to the Synapse bridge call could lead to funds being sent to the wrong chain.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the ```_bridgeAssetDirect``` function in ```HardenedTopupProxy.sol``` the chain id given in ```_bridgeTxData``` in ```_bridgeAssetDirect``` is not checked to be 1 (L1 ETH mainnet) when the bridgeType is 0 (Synapse bridge) which could lead to funds being sent to the wrong chain.

## Impact

User funds could be sent to the wrong chain.

## Code Snippet

[HardenedTopupProxy.sol:_bridgeAssetDirect#L416-L422](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L416-L422)
```solidity
        if (_bridgeType == 0)
        {
            // Synapse bridge call data is retrieved by performing a call by the application
            // to bridge SDK and is not transformed by this contract
            bytes memory callData = _bridgeTxData.slice(20, _bridgeTxData.length - 20);
            (bool success, ) = targetAddress.call(callData);
            require(success, "BRIDGE_CALL_FAILED");
```

The Synapse bridge's ```deposit``` function which could be called with any chain id.

```solidity
    function deposit(
        address to,
        uint256 chainId,
        IERC20 token,
        uint256 amount
    ) external {
        token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        if (token.allowance(address(this), address(synapseBridge)) < amount) {
            token.safeApprove(address(synapseBridge), MAX_UINT256);
        }
        synapseBridge.deposit(to, chainId, token, amount);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check in ```_bridgeTxData``` in the ```_bridgeAssetDirect``` function that the chain id passed to the Synapse bridge call is 1, for L1 ETH mainnet.
