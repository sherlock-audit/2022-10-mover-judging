# CONTROLLED DELEGATE CALL

## Summary

The contract was using delegatecall() or call() which was accepting address controlled by a user. This can have devastating effects on the contract as a delegate call allows the contract to execute code belonging to other contracts but using itâ€™s own storage. This can very easily lead to a loss of funds and compromise of the contract

```solidity
(bool success, ) = executorAddress.call{value: ethValue}(callData);
```

```solidity
 (bool success, /*bytes memory result*/) = address(_token).call(abi.encodePacked(IERC20PermitUpgradeable.permit.selector, _permit));
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Do not allow user-controlled data inside the delegatecall() and the call() function.
