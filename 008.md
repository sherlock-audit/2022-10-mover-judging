# HardenedTopupProxy's claimFees and emergencyTransfer can become stuck with zero reward transfer

## Summary
There are no checks for the amounts to be transferred via claimFees and emergencyTransfer. As the reward token list is external and an arbitrary token can end up there, when such a token doesn't allow for zero-amount transfers, the reward retrieval can become unavailable.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
HardenedTopupProxy's claimFees and emergencyTransfer can become stuck with zero reward transfer

## Code Snippet

        'IERC20Upgradeable(_token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, _amount);'

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L268

     'IERC20Upgradeable(_token).safeTransfer(_destination, _amount);'


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider running the transfers in claimFees and emergencyTransfer only when _amountis positive:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L251

        'if (_amount> 0) {
         IERC20Upgradeable(_token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, _amount);'

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L268

     'if (_amount> 0) {
      IERC20Upgradeable(_token).safeTransfer(_destination, _amount);'
