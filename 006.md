# Decimal difference can give incorrect amount to user

## Summary
The decimal places of _tokenTo is not considered before multiplying it with _exchangeFee which means the final amount might be incorrect

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Observe the [executeSwapDirect function]()

```python
function executeSwapDirect(
        address _beneficiary,
        address _tokenFrom,
        address _tokenTo,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _exchangeFee,
        bytes memory _data
    ) public payable override returns (uint256) {
...
if (_tokenTo != ETH_TOKEN_ADDRESS) {
            amountReceived = IERC20(_tokenTo).balanceOf(address(this));
        }
amountReceived = amountReceived.sub(
            amountReceived.mul(_exchangeFee).div(1e18)
        ); 
...
}
```

2. Here _tokenTo might be an erc20 token with 10 decimal places and without normalizing it is directly multiplied with _exchangeFee (18 decimal places) which will give incorrect final received amount

## Impact
User could receive lesser funds than required in case _tokenTo has very few decimal places

## Recommendation
Normalize the decimal places to 18 for _tokenTo
