# Not calling approve(0) before setting a new approval causes the call to revert when used with Tether (USDT)

## Summary
Not calling approve(0) before setting a new approval causes the call to revert when used with Tether (USDT)
## Vulnerability Detail
Not calling approve(0) before setting a new approval causes the call to revert when used with Tether (USDT)
## Impact
Some tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value (it will revert if the current approval is not zero to protect against front-running changes of approvals). These tokens must first be approved for zero and then the actual allowance can be approved.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/utils/SafeAllowanceReset.sol#L20
```solidity
  function resetAllowanceIfNeeded(IERC20 _token, address _spender, uint256 _amount) internal {
    uint256 allowance = _token.allowance(address(this), _spender);
    if (allowance < _amount) {
      uint256 newAllowance = 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff;
      IERC20(_token).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(_spender), newAllowance.sub(allowance));
    }
  }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use approve(address(_spender), 0) to set the allowance to zero immediately before each of the existing approve() calls.
