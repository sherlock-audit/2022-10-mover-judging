# Fee on transfer token not considered

## Summary
It was observed that while processing topup, contract is not considering token with fee on transfer. if cardTopupToken is set as a token with fees then the swaping will fail from existing contract balance

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Observe the [_processTopup function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L296)

```python
function _processTopup(address _beneficiary, address _token, uint256 _amount, uint256 _expectedMinimumReceived, bytes memory _convertData, uint256 _bridgeType, bytes memory _bridgeTxData, bytes32 _receiverHash) internal
    {
        // don't go further is contract function is paused (by admin or pauser)
        require(paused == false, "operations paused");

        if (_token == cardTopupToken) {
            // beneficiary is msg.sender (perform static check)
            IERC20Upgradeable(_token).safeTransferFrom(_beneficiary, address(this), _amount);

            uint256 feeAmount = _amount.mul(topupFee).div(1e18);

            // bridge from _beneficiary to card L1 relay
            _bridgeAssetDirect(_amount.sub(feeAmount), _bridgeType, _bridgeTxData);

            emit CardTopup(_beneficiary, _token, _amount, _amount.sub(feeAmount), _receiverHash);
            return;
        }
...
```

2. Now if token is cardTopupToken which takes fee on transfer then contract would have never received the _amount-fees

```python
if (_token == cardTopupToken) {
            // beneficiary is msg.sender (perform static check)
            IERC20Upgradeable(_token).safeTransferFrom(_beneficiary, address(this), _amount);

            uint256 feeAmount = _amount.mul(topupFee).div(1e18);
```

3. This means _bridgeAssetDirect will use the deducted fees part from own contract balance

```python
_bridgeAssetDirect(_amount.sub(feeAmount), _bridgeType, _bridgeTxData);
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Calculate the balance before and post transfer, the difference will tell the exact amount transferred to contract
