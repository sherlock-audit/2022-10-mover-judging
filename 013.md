# CardTopupTrusted is vulnerable against replay attacks on eventual chain forks

## Summary

The function `CardTopupTrusted` of the contract `HardenedTopupProxy` is vulnerable against replay attacks on eventual chain forks due to lack of `block.chainid` on the signed message from the trusted backend.

## Vulnerability Detail

In case of a chain split, signed messages from the trusted backend would still be valid on the forked chain since `constructMsg` does not encode `block.chainid` on the message to be hashed and signed. This might lead an attacker to process the topup on both chains and spend the users' allowance on the forked chain without their consent.

## Impact

High

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    /**
        @dev reconstruct a message to be verified (signed by trusted backend) that allowance is recent and of correct value
     */
    function constructMsg(bytes32 _addrhash, address _token, uint256 _amount, uint256 _timestamp) internal pure returns (bytes32) {
        return keccak256(abi.encodePacked("MOVER TOPUP ", _addrhash, " TOKEN ", _token, " AMOUNT ", _amount, " TS ", _timestamp));
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Implement [EIP 712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) for hashing and signing of typed structured data with the proper domain separator being updated in case of a chain split. 
- Make use of OpenZeppelin's [EIP712.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/EIP712.sol) smart contract for the `constructMsg` function
