# Loss of surplus Eth

## Summary
The ExchangeProxy contract accepts native token as Ether. In executeSwapDirect() function, it's compared whether the msg.value is equal or greater than the submitted `_amount` for the swap. But if the user sends more Eth than the submitted `_amount`, it remains in the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
The extra sent Eth remains in the contract and it's not refunded back even after a successful swap. There is `emergencyTransfer` function to send back the funds to the users who inadvertently sends their funds to the contract, however, this does not comply the urgent needs of the user which is having the remainder of the sent funds.
Even it's returned back by the admin after some time, the user will have disadvantage of it if in a bear market condition like we're in now.

## Impact
Loss of funds, financial lose of funds.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function executeSwapDirect(
        address _beneficiary,
        address _tokenFrom,
        address _tokenTo,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _exchangeFee,
        bytes memory _data
    ) public payable override returns (uint256) {
        require(msg.sender == transferProxyAddress, "transfer proxy only");


        // extract values from bytes array provided
        address executorAddress;
        address spenderAddress;
        uint256 ethValue;


        bytes memory callData = ByteUtil.slice(_data, 72, _data.length - 72);
        assembly {
            executorAddress := mload(add(_data, add(0x14, 0)))
            spenderAddress := mload(add(_data, add(0x14, 0x14)))
            ethValue := mload(add(_data, add(0x20, 0x28)))
        }


        // allow spender to transfer tokens from this contract
        if (_tokenFrom != ETH_TOKEN_ADDRESS && spenderAddress != address(0)) {
            require(trustedRegistryContract.isWhitelisted(spenderAddress), "allowance to non-trusted");
            resetAllowanceIfNeeded(IERC20(_tokenFrom), spenderAddress, _amount);
        }


        // remember the actual balance of target token (fees could reside on this contract balance)
        uint256 balanceBefore = 0;
        if (_tokenTo != ETH_TOKEN_ADDRESS) {
            balanceBefore = IERC20(_tokenTo).balanceOf(address(this));
        } else {
            balanceBefore = address(this).balance;
        }


        // regardless of stated amount, the ETH value passed to exchange call must be provided to the contract
        require(msg.value >= ethValue, "insufficient ETH provided");


        // don't allow to call non-trusted addresses
        require(trustedRegistryContract.isWhitelisted(executorAddress), "call to non-trusted");


        // ensure no state passed, no reentrancy, etc.
        (bool success, ) = executorAddress.call{value: ethValue}(callData);
        require(success, "SWAP_CALL_FAILED");


        // always rely only on actual amount received regardless of called parameters
        uint256 amountReceived = 0;
        if (_tokenTo != ETH_TOKEN_ADDRESS) {
            amountReceived = IERC20(_tokenTo).balanceOf(address(this));
        } else {
            amountReceived = address(this).balance;
        }
        amountReceived = amountReceived.sub(balanceBefore);


        require(amountReceived > 0, "zero amount received");


        // process exchange fee if present (in deposit we get pool tokens, so process fees after swap, here we take fees in source token)
        // fees are left on this contract address and are harvested by yield distributor
        //uint256 feeAmount = amountReceived.mul(_exchangeFee).div(1e18);
        amountReceived = amountReceived.sub(
            amountReceived.mul(_exchangeFee).div(1e18)
        ); // this is return value that should reflect actual result of swap (for deposit, etc.)


        if (_tokenTo != ETH_TOKEN_ADDRESS) {
            //send received tokens to beneficiary directly
            IERC20(_tokenTo).safeTransfer(_beneficiary, amountReceived);
        } else {
            //send received eth to beneficiary directly
            payable(_beneficiary).sendValue(amountReceived);
            // payable(_beneficiary).transfer(amountReceived);
            // should work for external wallets (currently is the case)
            // but wont work for some other smart contracts due to gas stipend limit
        }


        emit ExecuteSwap(_beneficiary, _tokenFrom, _tokenTo, _amount, amountReceived);
        
        // amount received is used to check minimal amount condition set by calling app from topup proxy contract
        return amountReceived;
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The code can be corrected as;
```solidity
require(msg.value = ethValue, "insufficient/surplus ETH provided");
```
