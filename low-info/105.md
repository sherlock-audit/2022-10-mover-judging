# Lack of explicity Slippage Check is vulnerable to front-running

## Summary

The function `executeSwap` will check for a non-zero return instead of checking for a non-front-run return

This slippage check is insufficient

Technically, a slippage check may be contained in `_data`, however, the current setup doesn't enforce that.
Meaning that end users can accept a bad trade unwillingly or unknowingly.

Adding an explicit minOut for the outToken will offer better UX and a clearer check (check for efficiency) vs just a non-zero check (check for satisfiability)
