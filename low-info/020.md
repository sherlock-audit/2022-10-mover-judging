# Incorrect Constant Naming Could Result In Losses

## Summary

There is a user role that is used to permit trusted backend services to execute transactions named `TRUSTED_EXETUTOR_ROLE`. This is incorrectly spelled.

## Vulnerability Detail

[`HardenedTopupProxy`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L68
)

The `TRUSTED_EXETUTOR_ROLE` is a role for trusted backend services to call functions within the topup proxy. This is a typo of "executor". Future references to this role with the correct spelling will fail.

## Impact

This contract is upgradable and future functionality may reuse the same role based access control. If a future release references this role with the correct spelling, the deployer will be forced to spend Ether on a subsequent deployment to fix this typo.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
bytes32 public constant TRUSTED_EXETUTOR_ROLE = keccak256("TRUSTED_EXECUTION");
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Correct the typo now so that loses from re-deployments to fix misspelled constants can be avoided:

```solidity
bytes32 public constant TRUSTED_EXECUTOR_ROLE = keccak256("TRUSTED_EXECUTION");
```
