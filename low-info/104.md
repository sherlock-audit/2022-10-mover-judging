# Dangerous lack of fee check can lead to unexpected costs

## Summary

The HardenedTopUpProxy has a comment about checking the `feePct` for Across Bridge, however no check is enforced.

If fee is even 10% for bridging, no-one would pay for that, especially for small amounts (to top up a card).

Naive users may end up accepting a fee that is beyond their expectation.

## Recommendation

I recommend a governance controlled lower check
Or to hardcode a check against a smaller value, all customers paying more than 3% will most likely be unhappy with the outcome (you took my money), especially if they are unaware of the underlying tech stach.
