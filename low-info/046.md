# M-01 `executeSwap` doesn't work

## Summary

Due to most likely a programming mistake, `executeSwap` will call `executeSwapDirect` and then revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

Because `executeSwap` calls `executeSwapDirect` it will always revert.

HardenedTopUpProxy is not programmed to call it either, leading me to believe this is a programming mistake.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function executeSwap(

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Delete the code if unused.
Or refactor to allow any caller to use it.
