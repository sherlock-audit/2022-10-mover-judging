# User can call any function of executorAddress which is dangerous

## Summary
Users can call any function of executorAddress which is dangerous.

## Vulnerability Detail
CallData (See ExchangeProxy.sol#L174) could be anything. 

Currently, (See ExchangeProxySwap.test.js#L44) 0xec6cc0cc is passed in to execute swapTokens function (See TokenSwapExecutorMock.sol#L39)

0xec6cc0cc can be anything to call other functions as long as the remaining code (See ExchangeProxy.sol#L178-L204) can be executed successfully.

## Impact
ExecuteSwapDirect could behave in an unpredictable manner because user can execute whatever functions they like.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Rather than depending on the users to call any functions they like, we should only restrict them to calling certain functions only.
