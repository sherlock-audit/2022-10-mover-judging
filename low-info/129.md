# Miners can influence the value of block.timestamp to perform Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) attacks.

## Summary 
Miners can influence the value of block.timestamp to perform Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) attacks.

block.timestamp is being used several times

## Vulnerability Detail

Block timestamps have historically been used for a variety of applications, such as entropy for random numbers (see the Entropy Illusion for further details), locking funds for periods of time, and various state-changing conditional statements that are time-dependent. Miners have the ability to adjust timestamps slightly, which can prove to be dangerous if block timestamps are used incorrectly in smart contracts.

Block timestamps should not be used for entropy or generating random numbersâ€”i.e., they should not be the deciding factor (either directly or through some derivation) for winning a game or changing an important state.

Time-sensitive logic is sometimes required; e.g., for unlocking contracts (time-locking), completing an ICO after a few weeks, or enforcing expiry dates. It is sometimes recommended to use block.number and an average block time to estimate times; with a 10 second block time, 1 week equates to approximately, 60480 blocks. Thus, specifying a block number at which to change a contract state can be more secure, as miners are unable to easily manipulate the block number.

## Recommendation
Use block.number instead of  block.timestamp or now to reduce the risk of
MEV attacks 
USE A MORE RECENT VERSION OF SOLIDITY and OpenZeppelin Library
current solidity version is 0.8.15 meanwhile project is using 0.8.6.
OpenZeppelin library currently 4.7.2 while the project is using 4.4.2.
It's best to use latest version because there are some features improvement and security patch.
