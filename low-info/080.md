# Rebasing tokens

## Summary
The project should consider adding functionality for blacklisting tokens such as rebasing tokens. As rebasing tokens act differently than deflationary tokens, balances get affected once the token is rebased.
## Vulnerability Detail
If -sometime in the future- the project decides to accept a popular token as a topup token (like Ampleforth used to be in mid 2020), it should be assessed that it wouldn't be a rebasing one. The codebase relies on the contract balance, hence the balances differ large for the bull and the bear market conditions.

## Impact
Top-up for free

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a blacklist function to prevent these types of tokens to be included in the project.
