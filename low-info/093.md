# Card Partner address lacks of sanity checks and not done in 2 steps

## Summary
HardenedTopupProxy has `setCardPartnerAddress` function to set the L1 Eth address for card topup settlement. But this important change should be in two steps as;
1. There is no sanity check carried out.
2. Human error
## Vulnerability Detail
A wrong card partner address set can lead the funds to be sent to a wrong EOA address including address(0), or worst - to a contract.
## Impact
Loss of funds
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function setCardPartnerAddress(address _cardPartnerAddress) public onlyAdmin {
        cardPartnerAddress = _cardPartnerAddress;
    }
```
