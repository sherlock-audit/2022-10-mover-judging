# executeSwap() function would always revert.

## Summary
The call to ExchangeProxy.executeSwap() reverts due to the access check in ExchangeProxy.executeSwapDirect()

## Vulnerability Detail
Since the call to ExchangeProxy.executeSwapDirect() checks that the caller is the `transferProxyAddress` , then the call to ExchangeProxy.executeSwap()  would always revert

## Impact
Reverts making function unsable.
