# `executorAddress` can be `address(this)`

## Summary
This is a supplementary check that's suggested for the future of the solution. No attack pattern can currently be exploited, but I figured the suggestion held some value.

## Vulnerability Detail
There's no guard preventing the attack pattern of inputing `executorAddress == address(this)` in `ExchangeProxy.executeSwapDirect()`. As this contract will probably get whitelisted (such naive hacks happened in production in the past), this could lead to a dangerous call to functions with `msg.sender == address(this)` (the ExchangeProxy contract). This attack pattern should be prevented.

In case of a compromise or misuse of `transferProxyAddress`, as `executorAddress` can be arbitrary and  `bytes memory _data` could create a call to any function, there would exist an attack-vector: 

```solidity
File: ExchangeProxy.sol
131:     function executeSwapDirect(
132:         address _beneficiary,
133:         address _tokenFrom,
134:         address _tokenTo,
135:         uint256 _amount,
136:         uint256 _exchangeFee,
137:         bytes memory _data
138:     ) public payable override returns (uint256) {
139:         require(msg.sender == transferProxyAddress, "transfer proxy only");
...
146:         bytes memory callData = ByteUtil.slice(_data, 72, _data.length - 72);
147:         assembly {
148:             executorAddress := mload(add(_data, add(0x14, 0)))
...
171:         require(trustedRegistryContract.isWhitelisted(executorAddress), "call to non-trusted");
172: 
173:         // ensure no state passed, no reentrancy, etc.
174:         (bool success, ) = executorAddress.call{value: ethValue}(callData); //@audit executorAddress can be address(this) and callData can be 
175:         require(success, "SWAP_CALL_FAILED");
```

## Recommendation
Consider preventing the potential attack vector by ensuring that `executorAddress != address(this)`, as this should never be necessary.
