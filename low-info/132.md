# Unprotected initialize function of the implementation contract

## Summary

There is no protection on calling `initialize` function on the implementation contract.

## Severity

Medium

## Vulnerability Detail

There is no protection from calling `initialize` function on the implementation contracts `ContractWhitelist` and `HardenedTopupProxy`. So anyone can call `initialize` on it with custom parameters. In case when implementation contract logic uses `delegatecall` instruction relying on "safe" initialization process parameters attacker has the possibility of substitution of `delegatecall` parameter by providing an address of the custom contract that destroys it using `selfdestuct` opcode.

## Impact

In case of an upgrade, implementation can contain logic that uses `delegatecall` (as an example, delegatecall is allowed only to the address that is provided by trusted `admin` during initialization). In such case, an attacker will have the ability to initialize the implementation contract with custom parameters and make it call (through a delegatecall) code that destroys itself with `selfdestruct` opcode. You can read more about similar vulnerability [here](https://www.parity.io/blog/a-postmortem-on-the-parity-multi-sig-library-self-destruct/).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding a special check that the `initialize` function is not called on the implementation contract. As an example, you can use the following pattern:

```solidity=
address private immutable __self = address(this);

modifier onlyProxyCall() {
    require(address(this) != __self, "Function must be called through delegatecall");
    _;
}

function initialize(...) public onlyProxyCall initializer ...
```
