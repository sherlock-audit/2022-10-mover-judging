# executeSwap() locks out user ETH

## Summary
executeSwap() locks out user ETH
## Vulnerability Detail
If both tokenFrom and tokenTo are not ETH, then the contract return fee will be an asset of ERC20(_tokenTo),
```solidity
        if (_tokenTo != ETH_TOKEN_ADDRESS) {
            //send received tokens to beneficiary directly
            IERC20(_tokenTo).safeTransfer(_beneficiary, amountReceived);
        } else {
            //send received eth to beneficiary directly
            payable(_beneficiary).sendValue(amountReceived);
            // payable(_beneficiary).transfer(amountReceived);
            // should work for external wallets (currently is the case)
            // but wont work for some other smart contracts due to gas stipend limit
        }
```

But if the user sends ETH to the contract during the operation, for this reason, even if ethValue is 0
```solidity
require(msg.value >= ethValue, "insufficient ETH provided");
```
We still don't rule out the possibility that users will send money. If so, the ETH sent by the user is locked in the contract and cannot be taken out by the user. Because the contract doesn't allow for that.
