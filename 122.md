# `_expectedMinimumReceived` should consider `topupFee`

## Summary

`_expectedMinimumReceived` in `_processTopup()` is currently only checked against the after-swap amount but not the post-fee amount.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation, the `_expectedMinimumReceived` check is done before deducting the `topupFee`.

However, the `topupFee` can be changed by the admin anytime.

When `_token == cardTopupToken`, the `_expectedMinimumReceived` check is missing. Which should be done as well to take the topup fee into consideration.

## Impact

If the user submits a topup transaction and the admin suddenly changed the fee from 1% to 20%, the user's transaction will still be successful, while the post-fee amount actually does not meet the `_expectedMinimumReceived`.

## Recommendation

Consider moving the `_expectedMinimumReceived` check to after deducting `feeAmount`.
