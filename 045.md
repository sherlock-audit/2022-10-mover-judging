# No Storage Gap for Upgradeable Contracts

## Summary
For upgradeable contracts, inheriting contracts may introduce new variables. In order to be able to add new variables to the upgradeable  contract without causing storage collisions, a storage gap should be added to the upgradeable contract.

If no storage gap is added, when the upgradable  contract introduces new variables, 
it may override the variables in the inheriting contract.


## Vulnerability Detail
Openzeppelin Storage Gaps notification:
```js
Storage Gaps
You may notice that every contract includes a state variable named __gap. 
This is empty reserved space in storage that is put in place in Upgradeable contracts. 
It allows us to freely add new state variables in the future without compromising 
the storage compatibility with existing deployments.
It isn’t safe to simply add a state variable because it "shifts down" 
all of the state variables below in the inheritance chain. 
This makes the storage layouts incompatible, as explained in Writing Upgradeable Contracts. 
The size of the __gap array is calculated so that the amount of storage used by a contract 
always adds up to the same number (in this case 50 storage slots).
```
## Impact
Storage gaps are a convention for reserving storage slots in a base contract, allowing future versions of that contract to use up those slots without affecting the storage layout of child contracts.

## Code Snippet

To create a storage gap, declare a fixed-size array in the base contract with an initial number of slots. 
This can be an array of uint256 so that each element reserves a 32 byte slot. Use the naming convention __gap so that OpenZeppelin Upgrades will recognize the gap:

```js
contract Base {
    uint256 base1;
    uint256[49] __gap;
}

contract Child is Base {
    uint256 child;
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a storage gap at the end of the upgradeable contract
```js
uint256[50] private __gap;
```
