# UPGRADEABLE CONTRACT IS MISSING A __GAP[50] STORAGE VARIABLE TO ALLOW FOR NEW STORAGE VARIABLES IN LATER VERSIONS

## Summary
See this link for a description of this storage variable. While some contracts may not currently be sub-classed, adding the variable now protects against forgetting to add it in the future.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/ContractWhitelist.sol#L16
```solidity
contract HardenedTopupProxy is AccessControlUpgradeable, SafeAllowanceResetUpgradeable {
    using SafeMathUpgradeable for uint256;
    using SafeERC20Upgradeable for IERC20Upgradeable;
    using AddressUpgradeable for address payable;
    using RLPReader for RLPReader.RLPItem;
    using RLPReader for bytes;
    using ByteUtil for bytes;

contract ContractWhitelist is AccessControlUpgradeable, IContractWhitelist {
    mapping(address => bool) whitelist;

    // events to track adding or removing items (should be monitored by security backend)
    event AddedToWhitelist(address indexed targetAddress);
    event RemovedFromWhitelist(address indexed targetAddress);

    // this contract uses role-based access, so init the default admin role to the
    // contract creator. this is high-privileged role and should be protected
    function initialize() public initializer {
        _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, _msgSender());
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
uint256[50] __gap; // gap to reserve storage in the contract for future variable additions
```
