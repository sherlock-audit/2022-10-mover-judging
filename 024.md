# Maxamount and minamount are not checked and may cause DOS

## Summary
Maxamount and minamount are not checked and may cause DOS
## Vulnerability Detail
Maxamount and minamount are not checked and may cause DOS
## Impact
minAmount and maxAmount can be set arbitrarily, with no time limit or size limit.
```solidity
    function setMinAmount(uint256 _minAmount) public onlyAdmin {
        minAmount = _minAmount;
    }

    function setMaxAmount(uint256 _maxAmount) public onlyAdmin {
        maxAmount = _maxAmount;
    }
```
It is possible to set the result to minAmount > maxAmount. If this happens, CardTopupMPTProof(),CardTopupTrusted() and CardTopupPermit() will not work properly because they all have the check _amount function

```solidity
require(_amount >= minAmount, "minimum amount not met");
require(_amount < maxAmount, "maximum amount exceeded");
```
