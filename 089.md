# _processTopup: slippage control may not work

## Summary
In the _processTopup function, the number of tokens received by the user may be less than _expectedMinimumReceived
## Vulnerability Detail
In the _processTopup function with slippage control, _expectedMinimumReceived should represent the minimum number of tokens the user actually received.
In fact, _expectedMinimumReceived represents the minimum number of tokens the user received after the swap, and then subtracts the fee, so that the actual number of tokens the user received may be less than _expectedMinimumReceived.
## Impact
The number of tokens received by the user may be less than _expectedMinimumReceived

Manual Review

## Recommendation

```diff
-       require(amountReceived >= _expectedMinimumReceived, "minimum swap amount not met");

        // fee is deducted in receiving token (USDC)
        if (topupFee != 0) {
            uint256 feeAmount = amountReceived.mul(topupFee).div(1e18);
            amountReceived = amountReceived.sub(feeAmount);
        }
+       require(amountReceived >= _expectedMinimumReceived, "minimum swap amount not met");

```
