# Should prevent users from sending more native tokens in the executeSwapDirect function

## Summary
It is possible for a user purchasing an option to accidentally overpay
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
When a user bridges a native token via the `executeSwapDirect ` function of `ExchangeProxy`, the contract checks whether `msg.value >= ethValue` holds. In other words, if a user accidentally sends more native tokens than he has to, the contract accepts it but only bridges the `ethValue` amount of tokens. The rest of the tokens are left in the contract and can be recovered by anyone (see another submission for details).


## Code Snippet

      'require(msg.value >= ethValue, "insufficient ETH provided");'
