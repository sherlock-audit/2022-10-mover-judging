# No clarity on the amount of fee set by admin. Could lead to loss of fund to protocol user. Lack of decentalisation

## Summary
The fee can be set to any value by the admin.

## Vulnerability Detail
If fee is equal to the amount that the user want to top-up, they will loose all of their money.

## Impact
The is kind of rug pull where owner can work unilaterally and take away user funds.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add fee based on the some percentage of amount that the user want to interact with the protocol.
This could be more transparent and gain trust from the crowd on the protocol.
