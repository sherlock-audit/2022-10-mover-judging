# `exchangeFee` can be escaped

## Summary

Comparing the before and after balance of the swap call for the swapped amount can be exploited to escape the `exchangeFee` by wrapping the actual swap inside a fake swap.

## Vulnerability Detail

The attacker can reenter with another `CardTopupPermit() -> _processTopup() -> IExchangeProxy#executeSwapDirect()` at L174 to claw back the fee:

1. Swap minAmount with 1inch, inside the 1inch swap at `ExchangeProxy.sol#L174`, reenter and `HardenedTopupProxy.sol#CardTopupPermit()`;
2. The inner swap is the actual amount: `$1M`, which should pay for `$1000` `exchangeFee`;
3. After the inner swap, `amountReceived` includes the `$1000` `exchangeFee`, which will be sent back to the user.

As a result, the user successfully escaped most of the `exchangeFee`.

## Impact

User can escape the `exchangeFee`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding `nonReentrant()` modifier to all the 3 non-view methods in the `HardenedTopupProxy`:

- CardTopupPermit();
- CardTopupTrusted();
- CardTopupMPTProof().
