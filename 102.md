# M-07 Infinite Allowance will not work for some tokens - Too big approval

## Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/utils/SafeAllowanceReset.sol#L20-L21

Specific tokens, such as `UNI` and `COMP` use uint96 for size, when passing too big of a value they will revert due to overflow.

See test case:
https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#revert-on-large-approvals--transfers

Recommendation:
Document that certain tokens may not work or add a try-catch and set to uint96 in case of revert
