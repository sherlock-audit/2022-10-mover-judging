# LACK OF REENTRANCY GUARDS ON EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS

## Summary
The following external functions within the mover contracts contain function calls (e.g. safeTransferFrom, safeTransfer) that pass control to external contracts. Additionally, if ERC777 tokens are being used within an order, it contains various hooks that will pass the execution control to the external party.
No re-entrancy attacks that could lead to loss of assets were observed during the assessment. 

The following shows examples of function call being made to an external contract

## Impact
No re-entrancy attacks that could lead to loss of assets were observed during the assessment. 


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to follow the good security practices and apply necessary reentrancy prevention by utilizing the nonReentrant modifier from Openzeppelin Library to block possible re-entrancy.
