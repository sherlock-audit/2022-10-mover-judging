# The admin can DOS any topup function by setting `allowanceTreshold` to `0`

## Summary
Breaking state: DOS by admin.

## Vulnerability Detail
The admin can DOS any topup function in `HardenedTopupProxy.sol` by setting `allowanceTreshold` to `0`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L184-L186

The following `checkAllowance` will always fail as it'll be impossible to pass the second check with an unsigned integer `< 0`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L286-L289

Given that the call to this check is made in every topup function and that they are the only real public functions without access control in `HardenedTopupProxy.sol`, this can become a dirty path to pause the contract. Such a misuse of the contract shouldn't be allowed.

## Impact
DOS

## Code Snippet
See `Vulnerability Detail`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either prevent `allowanceTreshold` from being `0` or change the strict inequality to a non-strict one in `checkAllowance`
