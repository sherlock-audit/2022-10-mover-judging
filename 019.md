# Card Top Up Replay Attack

## Summary

Card top ups facilitated from trusted infrastructure call a function in the Top Up Proxy. In the current implementation it is possible to replay top up transactions.

## Vulnerability Detail

[`HardenedTopupProxy.CardTopupTrusted`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L1031)

This implements functionality to process a card top up from a trusted backend system. There is the possibility under the following circumstances for a malicious actor to replay this transaction and top up a card multiple times from the same signature:

- `allowanceSignatureTimespan` must be set to a figure greater than 0 as transaction inclusion into a block is non-deterministic. If the sender does not know when their transaction will be included this provides a second based buffer to allow the sender to provide a function argument of the current time in seconds. This is intended as a mechanism to prevent replay attacks by giving a window where the signature should be accepted.
- Assume the backend has been compromised. An attacker has access to the key material that grants access to `TRUSTED_EXETUTOR_ROLE`.
- A transaction is received and the backend replays this transaction multiple times by calling `CardTopupTrusted` repeatedly with the signature it has received.

## Impact

- This causes multiple card top ups from a single top up signature. A user topping up their card has the transaction replayed multiple times and will succeed for as long as there is both a balance and allowance.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
require(block.timestamp - _timestamp < allowanceSignatureTimespan, "old sig");
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a cryptographic nonce into the signature and the contracts to prevent the same signature being used more than once.
