# Fee-on-transfer/deflationary tokens not supported

## Summary

The protocol could lose funds due to no support for fee-on-transfer/deflationary tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

The ```_processTopup``` function in ```HardendedTopupProxy.sol``` will receive tokens from the user and will either bridge the tokens directly if the token is the cardTopupToken or swap the tokens to the cardTopupToken using the ```executeSwapDirect``` function, then bridge the tokens to L1 ETH mainnet. When the token sent to the contract is the same as ```cardTopupToken``` then the function uses the amount input variable given to ```_processTopup``` instead of the actual amount received after the token transfer. If a fee-on-transfer token is used as the ```cardTopupToken``` instead of USDC then the actual amount received by the contract will be less than the amount given as input.

This issue does not seem to occur when the token is not the same as ```cardTopupToken``` since the ```executeSwapDirect``` function checks for actual amount received and returns only the amount received from the swap. The actual amount received by the protocol will be emitted with the CardTopup event.

## Impact

The protocol will lose funds because the user will receive more tokens than they should when the topup is processed on the backend infrastructure..

## Code Snippet

[HardenedTopupProxy.sol:_processTopup#L315-L326](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L315-L326)
```solidity
        if (_token == cardTopupToken) {
            // beneficiary is msg.sender (perform static check)
            IERC20Upgradeable(_token).safeTransferFrom(_beneficiary, address(this), _amount);

            uint256 feeAmount = _amount.mul(topupFee).div(1e18);

            // bridge from _beneficiary to card L1 relay
            _bridgeAssetDirect(_amount.sub(feeAmount), _bridgeType, _bridgeTxData);

            emit CardTopup(_beneficiary, _token, _amount, _amount.sub(feeAmount), _receiverHash);
            return;
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check the actual amount received from transfers by recording the balance before and after a transfer then taking the difference as the actual amount received.
