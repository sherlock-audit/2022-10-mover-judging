# CardTopupPermit calls can be griefed

## Summary
An attacker can frontrun all `CardTopupPermit` calls to make topping up the card impossible for a user.

## Vulnerability Detail
When an attacker sees a `CardTopupPermit` call in the mempool, he can extract the permit data from it, and call `permit` on the token itself with the provided data. Note that this works because any user can call `permit` for a different user given the signature (see e.g. https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/draft-ERC20Permit.sol#L49). Of course, it would not work when the attacker calls `CardTopupPermit` (because `msg.sender` is passed to `_processTopup`), as this function would revert. 

## Impact
When the `permit` call was frontrun, the second call (in `CardTopupPermit`) will revert, because the nonce was already used. Therefore, the topup of the user fails. Note that an attacker can repeat this attack multiple times to launch a DoS on a user and prevent him from ever using `CardTopupPermit` to top up his card.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In `CardTopupPermit`, it should be checked if the approval is already equal to the desired value (which would be the case when these calls are frontrun). Then, `permit` should not be called.
