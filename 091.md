# No validation of _exchangeProxyContract parameter when setting the address

## Summary
HardenedTopupProxy has `setExchangeProxy` function to set the trusted middleware contract. But there is no validation of the `_exchangeProxyContract` parameter to be of the same type of the exchange proxy.
## Vulnerability Detail
Without sanity checks for `_exchangeProxyContract` address in `setExchangeProxy`, the user funds would be sent to the `_exchangeProxyContract` but there would not be any swaps. And if the `_exchangeProxyContract` is not an accidentally set EOA, then the funds would be a totally loss (except good old Eth).
## Impact
Loss of funds
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function setExchangeProxy(address _exchangeProxyContract) public onlyAdmin {
        exchangeProxyContract = IExchangeProxy(_exchangeProxyContract);
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check the `_exchangeProxyContract` to be in IExchangeProxy interface.
