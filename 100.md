# M-05 Signature can be reused more than once

## Summary

Because the signature check is based on time, and there's no check to ensure a signature can only be used once, the signature can be re-used multiple times

## Vulnerability Detail

Reducing the `allowanceSignatureTimespan` will risk causing reverts when tx takes too long to process, vs making it too lenient will allow to submit multiple txs

## Impact

The signature, which should only be usable once, is re-usable until it expires

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation


It would be best to use a nonce system or mark the keccak of the signature as used, to avoid reusing it multiple times, which sidesteps the assumptions about security from the system
