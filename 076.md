# Anyone can frontrun and initialize Whitelist Contract to become admin and carry out admin activities

## Summary
There is no access control on the initialize() function for ContractWhitelist contract. Due to this, the malicious user would become admin and perform admin controlled activities.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no access control on the initialize() function for ContractWhitelist contract. This would allow anyone to be able to frontrun contract deployer's call to ContractWhitelist.initialize() and the user would become admin and make calls to the contract to add whitelisted addresses. This in turn would make the whitelisted address have allowance increased to spend in the call resetAllowanceIfNeeded() allowing the maliciously whitelisted contract to spend tokens and call transfer tokens from the exchange and topup contracts.

## Impact
ContractWhitelist ownership takeover and malicious addition of addresses to whitelists which can be used to drain tokens from ExchangeProxy and HardenedTopupProxy contracts

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/ContractWhitelist.sol#L25-L27

1. Contracts have been deployed and WhitelistContract has been set in HardenedTopupProxy contract
2. Alice frontruns contract owner's call to ContractWhitelist.initialize() 
3. Alice is now admin of the whitelist contract and adds addresses to the whitelist.
4. Alice then calls HardenedTopupProxy.CardTopupPermit() to make a topup in order to increase allowance for the whitelisted address.
5. Using the crafted `_bridgeTxData` , Alice is able to get allowance to spend tokens on behalf of HardenedTopUpProxy  increased to almost max value, in the call `HardenedTopupProxy._bridgeAssetDirect.resetAllowanceIfNeeded()`
6. Alice grants adminRole to the contract deployer who then revokes Alice's role and also removes all whitelisted contracts under Alice's control.
7. However deployer forgets to set the token allowance to 0.
8. Alice waits a while until contract contains enough tokens and then makes the call from the previous allowed contract and transfers all the tokens from HardenedTopUpProxy contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Apply necessary access control check to ensure the function is called my an authorized actor.
