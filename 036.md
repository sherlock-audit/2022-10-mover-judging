# `ExchangeProxy.executeSwap` is only callable by `transferProxyAddress`

## Summary
`ExchangeProxy.executeSwap` should be callable by anyone, but a check in `ExchangeProxy.executeSwapDirect` make it only callable by `transferProxyAddress`.

## Vulnerability Detail
`ExchangeProxy.executeSwap` should be callable  by anyone, the function send ERC20 tokens from `msg.sender` to the `ExchangeProxy` contract, then call `ExchangeProxy.executeSwapDirect` with `msg.sender` still being `tx.origin` but in `ExchangeProxy.executeSwapDirect` the following check is done:
```solidity
        require(msg.sender == transferProxyAddress, "transfer proxy only");
```
Therefore, no one but `transferProxyAddress` can use `ExchangeProxy.executeSwap` .
## Impact
`ExchangeProxy.executeSwap` should be callable by anyone, but is only callable by `transferProxyAddress`.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/ExchangeProxy.sol#L102
```soldiity
        return executeSwapDirect(msg.sender, _tokenFrom, _tokenTo, _amount, 0, _data);
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/ExchangeProxy.sol#L139
```soldiity
        require(msg.sender == transferProxyAddress, "transfer proxy only");
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A boolean could become true if the call come from executeSwap and could be added in the require statement:
```soldiity
        require(msg.sender == transferProxyAddress || executeSwapBool, "transfer proxy only");
```
Then, it would be reinitialized to false after the check is done.
