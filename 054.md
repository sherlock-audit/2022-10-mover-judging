# _bridgeTxData not checked when using the Synapse bridge could allow a user to topup without providing funds

## Summary

Due to a lack of checks for the ```_bridgeTxData``` given by a user in the ```_bridgeAssetDirect``` function in ```HardenedTopupProxy.sol```, the user could top up their funds without the protocol actually receiving any tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

The ```_processTopup``` function in ```HardenedTopupProxy.sol``` allows a user to choose between the Synapse bridge and the Across bridge and will also allow them to send arbitrary ```_bridgeTxData```. If the Synapse bridge is selected, it will be called with the arbitrary data given by the user in the ```_bridgeAssetDirect``` function thus the receiving address for the bridge could be set to an address controlled by the user instead of the ```cardPartnerAddress``` as in the [Across bridge case](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L432).

## Impact

A user could receive funds without the protocol receiving any tokens.

## Code Snippet

Below shows that the ```_bridgeAssetDirect``` function will call ```targertAddress``` (Synapse) with the ```_bridgeTxData``` provided by the user.

[HardenedTopupProxy.sol:_bridgeAssetDirect#L416-L422](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L416-L422)
```solidity
        if (_bridgeType == 0)
        {
            // Synapse bridge call data is retrieved by performing a call by the application
            // to bridge SDK and is not transformed by this contract
            bytes memory callData = _bridgeTxData.slice(20, _bridgeTxData.length - 20);
            (bool success, ) = targetAddress.call(callData);
            require(success, "BRIDGE_CALL_FAILED");
```

Below is the Synapse bridge's ```deposit``` function which could be called by the ```HardenedTopupProxy``` contract with the users tx data. The ```to``` address could be set to any address the user wants.

```solidity
    function deposit(
        address to,
        uint256 chainId,
        IERC20 token,
        uint256 amount
    ) external {
        token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        if (token.allowance(address(this), address(synapseBridge)) < amount) {
            token.safeApprove(address(synapseBridge), MAX_UINT256);
        }
        synapseBridge.deposit(to, chainId, token, amount);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check the ```_bridgeTxData``` in ```_bridgeAssetDirect``` (or ```_processTopup```) that the receiver of the bridged funds is the ```cardTopupAddress```.
