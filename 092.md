# Nonce is missing in signature schema in HardenedTopupProxy#constructMsg so signature can be reused to execute transaction.

## Summary

Nonce is missing in signature schema in HardenedTopupProxy#constructMsg, the trust executor address can reuse the signature multiple times.

## Vulnerability Detail

the signature schema used in HardenedTopupProxy#constructMsg is msg.sender, token address, amount and timestamp

```solidity
    /**
        @dev reconstruct a message to be verified (signed by trusted backend) that allowance is recent and of correct value
     */
    function constructMsg(bytes32 _addrhash, address _token, uint256 _amount, uint256 _timestamp) internal pure returns (bytes32) {
        return keccak256(abi.encodePacked("MOVER TOPUP ", _addrhash, " TOKEN ", _token, " AMOUNT ", _amount, " TS ", _timestamp));
    }
```

the nonce is not used, so the executor address can reuse the signature multiple times to execute the transaction.

## Impact

the nonce is not used, so the executor address can reuse the signature multiple times to execute the transaction.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the project add nonce to the signature schema and increase the nonce each time after the signature is used to make sure the signature cannot be reused.
