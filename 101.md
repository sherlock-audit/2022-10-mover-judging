# M-06 Non-Zero to Non-zero allowance change will break for specific tokens

## Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/utils/SafeAllowanceReset.sol#L20-L21

Specific tokens, such as `USDT` have a check to ensure allowance always changes from 0 to non-zero

For those tokens, setting approve(0) will allow compatibility.

On the other hand, going from non-zero to non-zero will not work and will cause a revert

### Remediation Step

Reset the allowance to 0 and then change it to max
