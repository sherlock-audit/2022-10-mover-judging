# Admin user is an unique failure point

## Summary
Admin users have the privilege to change `yieldDistributorAddress` that is correct but It could cause that previous yieldDistributor loose its fees.

## Vulnerability Detail
Assumption:
Previous `yieldDistributor` has a big amount in fees to claim.

Check the following steps
- Original `yieldDistributor` has more 100 ETH (or any big amount) in fees to claim.
- Admin decided to set a new `yieldDistributor`,
- New `yieldDistributor` claims for the fees that belongs to the previous one.

I mean that admin in the unique failure point in the process. So you are only trusting in the admins good intentions but it could be broken due to big amounts of money. It could happen if some private key's admin are stolen even.

The code does not protect (and should from my point of view) to the original `yieldDistributor` which is an interested actor in the process.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I suggest two possible solutions (or security improvement to the process):
1- Delay claim fees. 
- Set a contract field with block number like `currentBlock + 5760` (~1 day).
- Create a condition in `claimFees` method for `currentBlock > enableBlockToClaimFee`.

2- Validate claimed fee in `setYieldDistributor`.
- If remaining fees to claim is higher than some amount (1 ETH for instance), then revert new yield distributor assignation to avoid some malicious action.

Consider that adding some of the previous suggestions will make the protocol more incorruptible.

Finally, I recommend to emit some event when setting new `yieldDistributor`.
