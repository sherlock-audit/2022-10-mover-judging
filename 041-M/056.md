# Using the wrong token decimals for ERC20 tokens(usdc)

## Summary
Dividing with the wrong token decimals would lead to some calculations returning wrong values. E.g USDC with 6 decimals and is being divided by 18, USDC is even the token used in the docs.

## Vulnerability Detail
### Affected lines 
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L288
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L319

in [`checkAllowance`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L286), the allowance of the `msg.sender` would be checked against a wrong value, in [`_processTopUp`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mover/blob/main/cardtopup_contract/contracts/HardenedTopupProxy.sol#L350), the token decimal for `USDC` is 10e6 not 10e18 it is being divided with. Using a wrong decimal value higher or lower would result in the user loosing funds or the protocol deducting the wrong fees.
## Impact
Calculations would return wrong values.  This could lead to wrong fees(higher) be deducted from the user, and could lead to loss of funds for the user, or lower fees be deducted than expected.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Using [`IERC20Metadata`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#IERC20Metadata) instead of IERC20Upgradeable would fix the issue, and returning the decimal with `IERC20Metadata(token).decimal()`
```solidity
 uint256 feeAmount = _amount.mul(topupFee).div(IERC20Metadata(token).decimal()); 
```
