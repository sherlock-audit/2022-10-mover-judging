# Consistently check account balance before and after transfers for Fee-On-Transfer discrepancies

## Summary
In case ERC20 token is fee-on-transfer, the wrong amount will be swapped

## Vulnerability Detail
As arbitrary ERC20 tokens can be used, the amount here should be calculated every time to take into consideration a possible fee-on-transfer or deflation.
Also, it's a good practice for the future of the solution.

## Impact
The wrong amount will be swapped

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the balance before and after the transfer to calculate the received amount instead of assuming that it would be equal to the amount passed as a parameter. Or explicitly document that such tokens shouldn't be used and won't be supported
